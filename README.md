# Personal Github Page Powered by Quarto
 
This is the source file of my website using [Quarto](https//quarto.org). And by far, it is the easiest and most effective tool to build a site in my experience.

- Install Quarto: <https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/>

- Create a website: <https://quarto.org/docs/websites/>

- Copy the about.qmd from [blog](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-blog.html) to your folder and rename it to index.qmd

- Update _quarto.yml and add content to your blog posts

- Publish it on Github Pages: <https://quarto.org/docs/websites/publishing-websites.html>

All very straightforward to set up. If you follow the steps, the website is running as expected.

You can check out the site at <https://ullahsamee.github.io>.

And you can follow my updates by adding <https://ullahsamee.github.io/posts.xml> to your RSS reader.
