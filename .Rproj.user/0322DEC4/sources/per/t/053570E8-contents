I am Samee Ullah,a **Structural Biologist** and a former **Bioinformatician** at [National Institute of Health (NIH)](https://www.nih.org.pk/) [Islamabad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_WuTK9fH9Y) Pakistan. I specialize in understanding the structure and dynamics of proteins. My experience in protein structures modeling, De novo design, protein-protein interactions, and simulations allows me to predict how these molecules will interact with one another. I believe that understanding the structure & function of these molecules is essential to unlocking new treatments for diseases. I am constantly striving to improve my skills so that I can contribute to the advancement of science.

**Discipline:** *Structural Biology*

Samee's most recent collaborative analysis on the cost savings of global solar PV supply chains was published by [*Nature*](/posts/2022-10-nature-cost-savings-of-global-solar-pv-value-chains/index.qmd), and was awarded the [Best Poster Award](/posts/2022-12-iamc-2022-best-poster-award/index.qmd) by the Integrated Assessment Modeling Consortium (2022). He was selected as Youth Delegate to UNFCCC CoP11 (2005), Asia 21 Young Leaders (2007), Aspen Environment Forum Scholars (2011), Young Scholar of Institute for New Economic Thinking (2013), and [ITIF Energy Innovation Policy and Management Scholar](https://itif.org/events/2019/05/19/2019-itif-energy-innovation-boot-camp-for-early-career-scholars/) (2019).

Samee is a faculty affiliate with the [Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory](https://eta.lbl.gov/people/gang-he). He has worked for the [Program on Energy and Sustainable Development](https://pesd.fsi.stanford.edu/people/Gang_He) at Stanford University. He received his Ph.D. in [Energy and Resources](https://erg.berkeley.edu/people/gang-he/) from University of California, Berkeley. He also holds an M.A. in climate and society from Columbia University, and a B.S. and M.S. in Geography from Peking University.
