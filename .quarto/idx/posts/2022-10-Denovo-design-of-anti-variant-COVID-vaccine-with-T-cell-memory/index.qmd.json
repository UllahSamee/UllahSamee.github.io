As per the latest research nucleocapsid peptides are perfect immunological replacement of nucleocapsid protein. Therefore, peptide linking strategy is pursued (economic for cellular biosynthesis than whole protein). One envelope peptide with potent T-cell response is also chosen. This peptide is also functionally indispensable for the virus. All these peptides were clustered in our designed cytoplasmic domain separated by non-immunogenic helical linkers. We also propose the idea of introduction of any T-cell peptide similar to other Human Corona Viruses (HuCoV) in these linker regions whenever required. In addition to COVID, the same approach can be applied for any emergency or even long-term unsolved outbreaks of Influenza, Dengue and West Nile Virus etc. In this era of novelty as presented by subunit and nucleic acid vaccines, multiepitope strategies like this can help to combat multiple diseases successfully in real time to give hope for better future.\n\n## Links\n\nPublished [paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2022/10/20/2022.10.20.513049)\n\nResearchgate [pdf](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2022/10/20/2022.10.20.513049)\n\n```{=html}\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://d1bxh8uas1mnw7.cloudfront.net/assets/embed.js\"></script>\n```\n::: {.altmetric-embed data-badge-popover=\"right\" data-badge-type=\"donut\" data-doi=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molliq.2022.119393\"}\n:::\n\n```{=html}\n<script async src=\"https://badge.dimensions.ai/badge.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n```\n<!--Include social share buttons-->\n\n{{< include /files/includes/_socialshare.qmd >}}\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n<!--Include academic icons or bottons-->\n\n{{< include /files/includes/_academic.qmd >}}\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## Paper\nArpita Goswami1, S.
