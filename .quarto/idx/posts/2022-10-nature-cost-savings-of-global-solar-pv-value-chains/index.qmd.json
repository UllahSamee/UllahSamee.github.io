Here we assess the cost savings from a globalized solar photovoltaic (PV) module supply chain. We develop a two-factor learning model using historical capacity, component and input material price data of solar PV deployment in the United States, Germany and China. We estimate that the globalized PV module market has saved PV installers US\\$24 (19–31) billion in the United States, US\\$7 (5–9) billion in Germany and US\\$36 (26–45) billion in China from 2008 to 2020 compared with a counterfactual scenario where domestic manufacturers supply an increasing proportion of installed capacities over a ten-year period. Projecting the same scenario forwards from 2020 results in estimated solar module prices that are approximately 20–30 per cent higher in 2030 compared with a future with globalized supply chains. International climate policy benefits from a globalized low-carbon value chain, and these results point to the need for complementary policies to mitigate welfare distribution effects and potential impacts on technological crowding out.\n\n\n## Links\n\nPublished [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05316-6)\n\nPaper summary: [The Cost of Going Solo in Solar](/posts/2022-11-nature-solar-paper-summary/index.qmd)\n\nResearchGate [pdf](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/364757014_Quantifying_the_cost_savings_of_global_solar_photovoltaic_supply_chains) provided by *Nature*\n\nPreprint [pdf](/files/papers/2022-nature-solar-supply-chains-preprint.pdf)\n\nGithub: [solar-learning-2021](https://github.com/jhelvy/solar-learning-2021)\n\nZenodo: [Code and Data](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6989075)\n\nShinyapps: [Sensitivity visualization](https://jhelvy.shinyapps.io/solar-learning-2021/)\n\n## Impact\n\nAward: Integrated Assessment Modeling Consortium 2022 [Best Poster Award](/posts/2022-12-iamc-2022-best-poster-award/index.qmd)\n\n*Nature* Highlights: [Climate policy: Solar energy expected to be cheaper through globalization](https://www.natureasia.com/en/research/highlight/14262)\n\n*Joule* Preview: [The cost of risk mitigation—Diversifying the global solar PV supply chain](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joule.2022.12.003) by Nathan L.Chang, Mohammad Dehghanimadvar, and Renate Egan\n\nPress release: [SBU News](https://news.stonybrook.edu/newsroom/global-collaboration-is-key-to-saving-billions-for-solar-module-production/), [GWU News](https://mediarelations.gwu.edu/global-collaboration-saved-countries-67-billion-solar-panel-production-costs), [UCSD News](https://today.ucsd.edu/story/open-trade-saves-countries-billions-in-solar-panel-production)\n\nCoverage: [E&E News](https://www.eenews.net/articles/how-bidens-made-in-america-solar-strategy-may-backfire/), [GRID News](https://www.grid.news/story/global/2022/11/12/the-us-is-reducing-its-reliance-on-china-for-green-technology-could-that-slow-progress-on-climate-change/), [PV Magazine](https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/10/26/a-globalized-supply-chain-is-key-to-cutting-costs-in-solar-module-manufacturing/), [dot.LA](https://dot.la/deglobalization-2658510850.html), [pvbuzz](https://pvbuzz.com/new-study-quantifies-cost-savings-solar-industry-globalized-supply-chains/), [InnovateLongIsland](https://www.innovateli.com/no-736-on-immigrants-solar-energy-supplies-and-other-american-strengths-with-lots-of-candy-to-share/), [Mercom India](https://mercomindia.com/imposing-import-tariffs-hamper-of-solar-energy-study/), [China News](https://www.chinanews.com.cn/cj/2022/10-27/9881042.shtml), [Science and Technology Daily](http://www.stdaily.com/index/kejixinwen/202210/e38ea5c3a3054d87a43996d39a2924ab.shtml)\n\n[Nature Portfolio Chinese summary](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/CuyHGblyLcMfMo13VBXaFA)\n\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://d1bxh8uas1mnw7.cloudfront.net/assets/embed.js\"></script><div class=\"altmetric-embed\" data-badge-popover=\"right\" data-badge-type=\"donut\" data-doi=\"10.1038/s41586-022-05316-6\"></div>\n\n<span class=\"__dimensions_badge_embed__\" data-doi=\"10.1038/s41586-022-05316-6\" data-hide-zero-citations=\"true\" data-style=\"small_circle\"></span><script async src=\"https://badge.dimensions.ai/badge.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\n\n## Twitter Thread\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Excited to share new paper in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Nature?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@nature</a> with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JohnHelveston?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@JohnHelveston</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/east_winds?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@east_winds</a> on “Quantifying the cost savings of global solar photovoltaic supply chains”.<br><br>Paper: <a href=\"https://t.co/2DpBh4huDj\">https://t.co/2DpBh4huDj</a><br><br>pdf: <a href=\"https://t.co/F7oPjA67LR\">https://t.co/F7oPjA67LR</a> <br><br>Vis: <a href=\"https://t.co/a8Q306vnbq\">https://t.co/a8Q306vnbq</a> <br><br>More: <a href=\"https://t.co/OVmdOUHIfZ\">https://t.co/OVmdOUHIfZ</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/oFg4hGf9YK\">pic.twitter.com/oFg4hGf9YK</a></p>&mdash; Gang He (@DrGangHe) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DrGangHe/status/1585303259975061504?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 26, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\n\n## Poster\n\nHere is the poster for [IAMC2022](https://www.iamconsortium.org/event/fifteenth-iamc-annual-meeting-2022/) which won the [Best Poster Award](/posts/2022-12-iamc-2022-best-poster-award/index.qmd).

International climate policy benefits from a globalized low-carbon value chain, and these results point to the need for complementary policies to mitigate welfare distribution effects and potential impacts on technological crowding out.\n\n\n## Links\n\nPublished [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05316-6)\n\nPaper summary: [The Cost of Going Solo in Solar](/posts/2022-11-nature-solar-paper-summary/index.qmd)\n\nResearchGate [pdf](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/364757014_Quantifying_the_cost_savings_of_global_solar_photovoltaic_supply_chains) provided by *Nature*\n\nPreprint [pdf](/files/papers/2022-nature-solar-supply-chains-preprint.pdf)\n\nGithub: [solar-learning-2021](https://github.com/jhelvy/solar-learning-2021)\n\nZenodo: [Code and Data](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6989075)\n\nShinyapps: [Sensitivity visualization](https://jhelvy.shinyapps.io/solar-learning-2021/)\n\n## Impact\n\nAward: Integrated Assessment Modeling Consortium 2022 [Best Poster Award](/posts/2022-12-iamc-2022-best-poster-award/index.qmd)\n\n*Nature* Highlights: [Climate policy: Solar energy expected to be cheaper through globalization](https://www.natureasia.com/en/research/highlight/14262)\n\n*Joule* Preview: [The cost of risk mitigation—Diversifying the global solar PV supply chain](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joule.2022.12.003) by Nathan L.Chang, Mohammad Dehghanimadvar, and Renate Egan\n\nPress release: [SBU News](https://news.stonybrook.edu/newsroom/global-collaboration-is-key-to-saving-billions-for-solar-module-production/), [GWU News](https://mediarelations.gwu.edu/global-collaboration-saved-countries-67-billion-solar-panel-production-costs), [UCSD News](https://today.ucsd.edu/story/open-trade-saves-countries-billions-in-solar-panel-production)\n\nCoverage: [E&E News](https://www.eenews.net/articles/how-bidens-made-in-america-solar-strategy-may-backfire/), [GRID News](https://www.grid.news/story/global/2022/11/12/the-us-is-reducing-its-reliance-on-china-for-green-technology-could-that-slow-progress-on-climate-change/), [PV Magazine](https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/10/26/a-globalized-supply-chain-is-key-to-cutting-costs-in-solar-module-manufacturing/), [dot.LA](https://dot.la/deglobalization-2658510850.html), [pvbuzz](https://pvbuzz.com/new-study-quantifies-cost-savings-solar-industry-globalized-supply-chains/), [InnovateLongIsland](https://www.innovateli.com/no-736-on-immigrants-solar-energy-supplies-and-other-american-strengths-with-lots-of-candy-to-share/), [Mercom India](https://mercomindia.com/imposing-import-tariffs-hamper-of-solar-energy-study/), [China News](https://www.chinanews.com.cn/cj/2022/10-27/9881042.shtml), [Science and Technology Daily](http://www.stdaily.com/index/kejixinwen/202210/e38ea5c3a3054d87a43996d39a2924ab.shtml)\n\n[Nature Portfolio Chinese summary](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/CuyHGblyLcMfMo13VBXaFA)\n\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://d1bxh8uas1mnw7.cloudfront.net/assets/embed.js\"></script><div class=\"altmetric-embed\" data-badge-popover=\"right\" data-badge-type=\"donut\" data-doi=\"10.1038/s41586-022-05316-6\"></div>\n\n<span class=\"__dimensions_badge_embed__\" data-doi=\"10.1038/s41586-022-05316-6\" data-hide-zero-citations=\"true\" data-style=\"small_circle\"></span><script async src=\"https://badge.dimensions.ai/badge.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\n\n## Twitter Thread\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Excited to share new paper in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Nature?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@nature</a> with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JohnHelveston?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@JohnHelveston</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/east_winds?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@east_winds</a> on “Quantifying the cost savings of global solar photovoltaic supply chains”.<br><br>Paper: <a href=\"https://t.co/2DpBh4huDj\">https://t.co/2DpBh4huDj</a><br><br>pdf: <a href=\"https://t.co/F7oPjA67LR\">https://t.co/F7oPjA67LR</a> <br><br>Vis: <a href=\"https://t.co/a8Q306vnbq\">https://t.co/a8Q306vnbq</a> <br><br>More: <a href=\"https://t.co/OVmdOUHIfZ\">https://t.co/OVmdOUHIfZ</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/oFg4hGf9YK\">pic.twitter.com/oFg4hGf9YK</a></p>&mdash; Gang He (@DrGangHe) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DrGangHe/status/1585303259975061504?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 26, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\n\n## Poster\n\nHere is the poster for [IAMC2022](https://www.iamconsortium.org/event/fifteenth-iamc-annual-meeting-2022/) which won the [Best Poster Award](/posts/2022-12-iamc-2022-best-poster-award/index.qmd).
