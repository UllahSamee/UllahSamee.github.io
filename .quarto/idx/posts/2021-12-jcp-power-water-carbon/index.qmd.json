We investigate long-term transition pathways (2020–2050) of China's power sector under carbon neutrality target and water withdrawal constraint using an integrated capacity expansion and dispatch model: SWITCH-China. We find that achieving carbon neutrality before 2060 under moderate cost decline of renewables by 10–20% depends heavily on large scale deployment of coal-fired power generation with carbon capture and storage (CCS) since 2035 in China's water-deficient northwestern regions, which may incur significant water penalties in arid catchments. Introducing water withdrawal constraints at the secondary river basin level can reduce the reliance on coal-CCS power generation to achieve carbon neutrality, promote the application of air-cooling technology, and reallocate newly built coal power capacities from northwestern regions to northeastern and southern regions. If levelized cost of renewables can decline rapidly by about 70%, demand for coal power generation with CCS will be significantly reduced by more than 80% and solar photovoltaic (PV) and wind could account for about 70% of the national total power generation by 2050. The transition pathway under low-cost renewables also creates water conservation co-benefits of around 10 billion m3 annually compared to the reference scenario.\n\n\n## Links\n\nPublished [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095965262103941X>)\n\nSelf-archiving [pdf](/files/papers/2021-JCP-ChinaPowerCarbonWaterNexus.pdf)\n\n[Supplementary Data](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S095965262103941X-mmc1.docx)\n\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://d1bxh8uas1mnw7.cloudfront.net/assets/embed.js\"></script><div class=\"altmetric-embed\" data-badge-popover=\"right\" data-badge-type=\"donut\" data-doi=\"10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.129765\"></div>\n\n<span class=\"__dimensions_badge_embed__\" data-doi=\"10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.129765\" data-hide-zero-citations=\"true\" data-style=\"small_circle\"></span><script async src=\"https://badge.dimensions.ai/badge.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\n\n## Poster\n\n![](/files/posters/electricity-carbon-water-poster.jpeg){fig-align=\"left\" width=95%}\n\n\n## Twitter Thread\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">New paper on energy-water nexus: Long-term transition of China’s power sector under carbon neutrality target and water withdrawal constraint.<br><br>With lead author Chao Zhang and coauthors Josiah Johnston, and Lijin Zhong.<br><br>Paper link: <a href=\"https://t.co/Ujwtk42Zmx\">https://t.co/Ujwtk42Zmx</a><br><br>DM for a pdf. <a href=\"https://t.co/6QYrLLnWtv\">pic.twitter.com/6QYrLLnWtv</a></p>&mdash; Gang He (@DrGangHe) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DrGangHe/status/1462407719231569920?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 21, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\n<!--Include social share buttons-->\n\n{{< include /files/includes/_socialshare.qmd >}}","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## Paper\nLong-term transition of China's power sector under carbon neutrality target and water withdrawal constraint   \nChao Zhang, **Gang He**\\*, Josiah Johnston, and Lijin Zhong   \n*Journal of Cleaner Production* (2021)   \nDOI: [10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.129765](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.129765)\n:::\n\n## Abstract\n\nDeep carbon mitigation and water resources conservation are two interacted environmental challenges that China's power sector is facing.
