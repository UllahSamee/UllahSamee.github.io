Despite their nucleobase-decorated nature, their binding to natural nucleic acid targets does not necessarily involve all nucleopeptide bases, as we showed in this study. Here, we present a CD study on the interaction of a dithymine-functionalized tetra-L-serine with a homoadenine DNA (dA12) reporting an interpretation of the experimental data in light of our computational studies based on molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD), as well as computer-assisted CD interpretation and simulation of the predicted complex structure. The stoichiometry of the complex, emerged by CD titration, accounted for a 1:2 T:A ratio. Hence, we supposed that binding did not involve a full pairing of the complementary bases but a partial thymines engagement. This hypothesis was sustained by the docking and MD simulations performed on the selected ligand and the complementary target of DNA and RNA, used for comparison. The nucleopeptide bound the DNA through a single A-T recognition involving complementary base-pairing, as well as by some interactions between its backbone (and in particular L-serine OH) and the nucleic acid. Overall, this confirmed that nucleopeptides can interact with nucleic acids leaving some of their nucleobases free for establishing further interactions with other biomolecules or for crosslinking in supramolecular structures in aqueous solution. Nevertheless, even though no typical DNA secondary structure is formed after nucleopeptide-binding, this ligand is able to induce a higher degree of structuration in the random deoxyoligonucleotide target as evidenced by CD, MD and CD simulation.\n\n## Links\n\nPublished [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167732221027008)\n\nResearchGate
