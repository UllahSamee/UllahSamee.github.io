The Chinese economy is supposed to become climate neutral by 2060, but energy security is always an important requirement for the Chinese government, the scientist explains.

The result: compared to relocating production to Germany, German buyers of solar panels saved about 6.5 billion euros between 2008 and 2020. There are concerns about buying Chinese photovoltaic systems with regard to jobs, human rights, and the high level of dependency.
