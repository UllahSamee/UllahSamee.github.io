I am an ambitious and motivated, Computational Structural biologist with expertise in analyzing proteins and nucleic acid structures, interactions, and dynamics. Experience with structural modeling, de-novo design, simulations, and binding affinity. Background includes research investigation on protein-small molecules and peptides-nucleic acids interactions using an array of cutting-edge computational methods and experimental. Super passionate about working on impactful structural biology projects to gain atomic-level insights into intricate molecular complexes and guiding therapeutic design. **Now** **seeking PhD position,** to leverage my specialized skills and knowledge in bio-molecular structure analysis, and molecular design to push the boundaries of biological knowledge.

Previously, I worked as a Bioinformatician in a project ***"Lab Diagnostic and Existing Surveilliance System Strengthening for Pandemic Outbreak Management"*** funded by Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation(BMFG) at the [National Institute of Health (NIH)](https://www.nih.org.pk/){style="font-size: 11pt;"}, during pandemic, where I further honed my expertise in;

-   [Molecular Dynamics Simulations (MDS)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167732221027008#:~:text=%2C-,Samee%20Ullah,-c)

-   [Structure Based Drug Design (SBDD)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S016773222200931X#:~:text=Samantha%20Sibuyi%20b-,%2C,Samee%20Ullah%20f,-%2C)

-   [De-novo Protein Design](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=wtuV29QAAAAJ&citation_for_view=wtuV29QAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC#:~:text=Madan%20S%20Kumar%2C-,Samee%20Ullah%2C,-Milind%20M%20Gore)

-   [Structural and Mutational Analysis](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=wtuV29QAAAAJ&citation_for_view=wtuV29QAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC#:~:text=Authors-,Samee%20Ullah,-%2C%20Afreenish%20Amir%2C%20Aamer)

My journey, in the realm of bio-molecular structures started during my MS/MPhil studies at the [National Center for Bioinformatics (NCB)](#0){style="font-size: 11pt;"}, where I worked on *"Proteome-wide analysis for potential druggable candidates against Morganella morganii", in which I completed my thesis in the [Azam Lab](https://www.researchgate.net/lab/Syed-Sikander-Azam-Lab-2)*. Before joining the Azam Lab, I was working as a Research assistant in [Dasti Lab](https://www.qau.edu.pk/profile.php?id=805016), where I analyzed the sequences of *"CTXM-15 virulence profile of Uropathogenic E.coli (UPEC) strains"* from Pakistan, which later I [submitted](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MK770327.1/#:~:text=1%20%20(bases%201%20to%20444)%0A%20%20AUTHORS%20%20%20Ali%2CI.%2C%20Rafaque%2CZ.%2C-,Ullah%2CS.,-%2C%20Salzman%2CE.%2C%20Graham%2CS.E.%2C%20Foxman%2CB.%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20and%20Iqbal%20Dasti) to Genbank NCBI.

I envision myself becoming a structural biologist over the next decade, driven by the conviction that elucidating the intricate molecular architectures of proteins and nucleic acids is the key to developing novel therapies for numerous diseases. My insatiable curiosity about the nanoscopic world of atoms. chemical bonds and structures fuels my passion for this cutting-edge field. The next ten years will be an exciting voyage for me.

**Discipline:** *Structural Bioinformatics*
