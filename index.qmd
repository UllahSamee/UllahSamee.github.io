::: {#hero-heading}
Structural Biologist and deep interest in proteins and nucleic acid structures, their interactions with peptides, small molecules and membranes. My passion for exploring the intricate world of biomolecular structures drives me to dive deep into their complexities using state-of-the-art tools and technique. Previously I worked as a **Bioinformatician** at [National Institute of Health (NIH)](https://www.nih.org.pk/){style="font-size: 11pt;"} [Islamabad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_WuTK9fH9Y){style="font-size: 11pt;"} Pakistan. I possess strong expertise in the areas of proteins structural modeling and analysis, De-novo design, simulations, binding energy and affinity analysis. I believe that understanding the structure & function of these molecules is essential to unlocking new treatments for diseases. I am constantly striving to improve my skills so that I can contribute to the advancement of science.


**Discipline:** *Structural Biology*

Samee's most recent corresponding author paper, [*Computational insights on the destabilizing mutations in the binding site of 3CL-protease SARS-CoV-2 Omicron (VOC)*](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.05.24.542061v1) is now availabe at biorxiv preprint server.\*

After completing his MPhil in Bioinformatics from the [National Center for Bioinformatics (NCB)](#0){style="font-size: 11pt;"}, samee joined the [National Institute of Health (NIH)](https://www.nih.org.pk/){style="font-size: 11pt;"} as a **Bioinformatican** during pandemic in a two year project title "*Lab Diagnostic and Existing Surveilliance System Strengthening for Pandemic Outbreak Management*" funded by Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. During this time, he worked on "*SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences* *and screened the variants including B.1.1.7 and OMICRON first case reports in Pakistan for the mutation, structure based drug design studies".* He co-authored many Q1 research articles with the prestigious institutes including Ohio State University USA, National Research Council (CNR) Italy and King Abdullah International Medical Research Center (KAIMRC). He also trained more than 70 graduates and undergraduates in the Computaional Structural biology techniques at NIH during pandemic as well.
