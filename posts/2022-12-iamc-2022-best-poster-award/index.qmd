## Summary

This article reports the first detection of the SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.1.7 in Pakistan, which was imported from the United Kingdom by travelers. The variant was identified by genomic sequencing of samples collected from 12 passengers who tested positive for COVID-19 upon arrival at the Islamabad airport. We describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of the cases, as well as the public health measures taken to prevent further spread of the variant in the country. Furthermore highlighting the need for enhanced surveillance and testing of international travelers, as well as genomic characterization of *SARS-CoV-2* strains circulating in Pakistan.
