    "text": "Abstract\nIntegrating variable energy resources, notably solar and wind, requires better understanding of where, when and how much of variable resources are available. China‚Äôs ambitious solar energy development goal will be greatly facilitated by the resources assessment at higher spatial and temporal resolution. We utilized 10-year hourly solar irradiation data from 2001 to 2010 from 200 representative locations to develop provincial solar availability profiles. We found that China has a potential stationary solar capacity from 4700 GW to 39300 GW, distributed solar about 200 GW, and the annual solar output could reach 6900 TWh to 70100 TWh. Resources are most concentrated in northwest provinces, topped by Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang and Gansu. The challenge of solar development in China is integration rather than resources. The spatial and temporal variation of the solar resource show an efficient, robust, and inter-connected national grid and sound energy planning would be necessary to facilitate the integration of these vastly available but variable solar resources."

    "text": "Abstract\nDeep carbon mitigation and water resources conservation are two interacted environmental challenges that China‚Äôs power sector is facing. We investigate long-term transition pathways (2020‚Äì2050) of China‚Äôs power sector under carbon neutrality target and water withdrawal constraint using an integrated capacity expansion and dispatch model: SWITCH-China. We find that achieving carbon neutrality before 2060 under moderate cost decline of renewables by 10‚Äì20% depends heavily on large scale deployment of coal-fired power generation with carbon capture and storage (CCS) since 2035 in China‚Äôs water-deficient northwestern regions, which may incur significant water penalties in arid catchments. Introducing water withdrawal constraints at the secondary river basin level can reduce the reliance on coal-CCS power generation to achieve carbon neutrality, promote the application of air-cooling technology, and reallocate newly built coal power capacities from northwestern regions to northeastern and southern regions. If levelized cost of renewables can decline rapidly by about 70%, demand for coal power generation with CCS will be significantly reduced by more than 80% and solar photovoltaic (PV) and wind could account for about 70% of the national total power generation by 2050. The transition pathway under low-cost renewables also creates water conservation co-benefits of around 10 billion m3 annually compared to the reference scenario."

With the goal of creating initial plans for curriculum design and assessment frameworks, this workshop illuminated the need to improve undergraduate data science education through university and industry partnerships.\nThe workshop was kicked off by Fotis Sotiropoulos, Dean of the College of Engineering and Applied Sciences (CEAS), in which he highlighted the exciting STEM science education programs within CEAS and the contribution of the late Dr.¬†David Ferguson, a national leader in STEM education who passed in 2019. Dean Sotiropoulos invited the participants to ‚Äúenvision the future of education and research in the era of intelligent machines.‚Äù\nKeynote speaker Jay Labov, former Senior Advisor for the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, criticized current education practice in data science. He argued that too many students leave STEM majors because they do not find math formulas taught in class relevant to them. He said, ‚ÄúMost students would say ‚ÄôI left STEM because it doesn‚Äôt speak to me. I thought I was going to be here, trying to help solve the world‚Äôs problems. What I find myself was in the classroom with five hundred undergraduates with a talking head in front putting up all kinds of equations that make no sense.‚Äù\nIn response, a panel, including Anand Rao (Data & Analytics PwC), Bonita London (Psychology SBU), Wei Zhu (Applied Math and Statistics SBU), and Nikki Evans (Director of Workforce Partnerships, CUNY), moderated by Marianna Savoca (Career Center SBU), presented their ideas to plug the leaky STEM pipeline through innovations in classroom teaching and industry-university partnerships.\nMinghua Zhang, Interim Provost of Stony Brook University, joined the workshop for lunch to welcome all participants and highlighted the challenges and uncertainties both in data collecting and data analyzing.\nIn the second keynote, Carrie Cullen Hitt, Executive Director of the National Offshore Wind Research and Development Consortium, illustrated how data science can improve efficiency in energy sectors by collecting and monitoring information generated, for instance, by wind turbines. Built on that premise, two panels further reviewed data science applications for clean energy and urban sustainability respectively. Panelists included: Vijay Modi (Columbia University), Vincent Guastamacchia (PSEG Long Island) led by Gang He (Technology and Society SBU), and Mark Rodgers (Rutgers Business School), Jeremy Schneider (The Alliance for Downtown NY), Omkar Aphale (Cascadia), Daniel Cisek (National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency), Katrina Sutton and Vaishnavi Karanam (UC Davis) moderated by Elizabeth Hewitt (Tech and Society SBU).\nAddressing data science misuse in the third keynote, Suresh Venkatasubramanian, Professor in the School of Computing at the University of Utah, unearthed hidden decisions involving ethical dilemmas that data scientists must make throughout their work pipeline, from data collection through insights generation. ‚ÄúWe do make many implicit choices in every stage of the pipeline when we do the analysis. We don‚Äôt often think about whether these have any long-term consequences,‚Äù he said.\nThe final session, moderated by Wolf Sch√§fer (Technology and Society SBU), highlighted the need for ethics training in data science majors. In the panel, Derek Leben (University of Pittsburgh), Carl Hobert (author and conflict resolution expert), Robert Crease (Philosophy SBU), and Daniene Byrne (Technology and Society SBU) shared their work examining ethical decision process in data science and technology applications.\n‚Äî Firman Firmansyah"

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nRenewable energy is poised to play a major role in achieving China‚Äôs carbon neutrality goal by 2060; however, reliability and flexibility is a big concern of a renewable-dominant power system. Various strategies of enhancing flexibility are under discussion to ensure the reliability of such a system, but no detailed quantitative analysis has been reported yet in China. We combine the advantages of a capacity expansion model, SWITCH-China, with a production simulation model, PLEXOS, and analyze flexibility options under different scenarios of a renewable-dominant power system in China. We find that a larger balancing area offers direct flexibility benefits. Regional balancing could reduce the renewable curtailment rate by 5‚Äì7%, compared with a provincial balancing strategy. National balancing could further reduce the power cost by about 16%. However, retrofitting coal power plants for flexible operation would only improve the system flexibility marginally."

I‚Äôm grateful for the Integrated Assessment Modeling Consortium 2022 Best Poster Award for online poster presentation.\nI‚Äôd like to take the opportunity to share the main messages of the paper. To achieve carbon neutrality, the world must embark on a rapid and massive deployment of renewable energy. However, certain decoupling policies that restrict the free flow of capital, talent, and innovation may delay the continuous reduction in costs of renewable energy. The international climate policy now faces a crossroads - to continue relying on global supply chains or to shift towards domestic technology development and production.\nOur research captures this policy dilemma and assesses the cost savings associated with a globalized solar PV module supply chain. We created a two-factor hybrid learning model that considers historical capacity, component, and input material prices of solar PV deployment from the United States, Germany, and China. The results show that the globalized PV module market has saved PV installers $24 billion in the US, $7 billion in Germany and $36 billion in China from 2008 to 2020, compared to a scenario where domestic manufacturers increasingly supplied installed capacities over a ten-year period. Projecting the same scenario forward to 2030, we estimate that solar module prices will be about 20-30% higher than with a globalized supply chain. Our findings emphasize the importance of international cooperation in the pursuit of a low-carbon future."

    "text": "Electricity for all\nChina declared full electrification in 2015 after connecting 2.7 million people in remote areas.\nChina‚Äôs energy, pollution, and climate change issues produce a steady blizzard of headlines: it has become the world‚Äôs biggest carbon emitter, the world‚Äôs largest energy producer, and the biggest producer, consumer and importer of coal. Nonetheless, it has stepped into a leadership role on climate change after the US withdrew from the Paris Agreement. And so on.\nOften lost in all this is a major advance: China has achieved full electrification for its population of 1.4 billion, even in its remotest villages.\nAbout one billion people worldwide have no electricity, and another 1.5 billion lack reliable electricity so China‚Äôs success offers useful lessons for other countries struggling to connect remote, poor areas."

I was born in a small village in Hunan province, in central China, and am old enough to remember a life without electricity. Many people today would panic after an hour‚Äôs disconnection from the electricity grid. Where to charge their phone? What to do without a wi-fi connection? Back then, for my family it was normal. Kerosene lamps for light, a wood-save stove for cooking ‚Äì a model that was already an improvement on previous versions because it used less wood. However, the smoke remained a major source of air pollution, and was especially harmful to women and children, who spent most time indoors.\nProviding electricity to all is about humanity. Without electricity, other essential steps for human development such as providing modern public health services or narrowing the digital divide, are daunting to solve."

    "section": "Huge hurdles",
    "text": "Huge hurdles\nChina‚Äôs road to full electrification has been rough. Initially reliant on imports for its grid and generating capacity, China then had to reshape its institutions to create the financial arrangements to incentivise investment and grid connection. Admittedly, many Western countries achieved electrification for large populations from the 1950s to 1970s. So what‚Äôs distinctive about China‚Äôs experience?\nChina tackled rural electrification in two waves.\nThe first wave provided electricity to 97% of the population by the late 1990s. Extensions to the power grid carried electricity to about 80% of rural Chinese, while the rest gained access through small hydro and small coal-fired power plants (up to 50 megawatts) connected into local and regional grids.\nWinning the battle to bring electricity to the final 3% was much harder. Success came from China‚Äôs notable advances in extending and renovating rural grids.\nEven so, grid extensions could not reach everyone in a cost-effective manner.\nIn 2012, the central government issued a 3-year action plan, ‚ÄúElectricity for All (2013-2015)‚Äù1, to connect the final 2.73 million people. It succeeded. China declared full electrification in 2015."

    "section": "Experiences",
    "text": "Experiences\nWhat can the rest of the world learn? There are three lessons from China‚Äôs final, successful effort to electrify.\n\nCo-ordinate all stakeholders\nDespite prioritising electrification, the central government alone could neither implement the necessary investments, nor manage highly decentralised infrastructures. China‚Äôs central government therefore provided policy leadership and investment, but with extensive local coordination. Provincial governments examined local conditions and coordinated project implementation. Some conducted trials of different approaches and technologies, as the best strategies for ubiquitous electrification were not obvious.\nCentral government also sat at the centre of vital cost sharing schemes. For example, between 2013-2015 it allocated 24.8 billion yuan (approximately US$4 billion) for grid extensions and small off-grid solar photovoltaic (PV) systems. Roughly 60%, or 14.6 billion yuan, came from central budgets. State-owned power companies and local governments provided the rest. Officials also used private firms to fund and implement PV projects. Central government investment sharing varied province-by-province, ranging from 20% to 80%. For instance, the poorest region involved was Tibet, where development projects are particularly expensive, so central government paid 80% of the costs, higher than average.\nWhat‚Äôs important to learn from the Chinese approach is the indispensable role of reliable funding, which in China‚Äôs case, came from the centre, along with the importance of guided experimentation and learning.\n\n\nSelect appropriate technologies\nThe final round of electrification was split 50/50 between grid extension and off-grid solar PV. Although more reliable, grid connection proved too expensive and inflexible for the remotest populations. Trials showed costs as high as 100,000 yuan (US$16,000) per household, depending on terrain and distance to the substation.\nDistributed solar PV at 0.5-1kW per household had better system reliability, but such micro-grids were also costly, averaging 9,000-20,000 yuan (US$1,400-3,200) per household.\nIndividual solar PV at 0.3-0.4kW per household was the cheapest option, costing between 7,500-11,200 yuan (US$1,200-1,800) per household. Generally, such systems were preferable, according to National Energy Administration guidelines, anywhere with less than 20 households per square kilometre. Grid systems were prohibitive yet households preferred their greater reliability and responsiveness to demand.\nConnecting the remotest households involves major trade-offs between power quality, level of supply and cost, though they may be lessened by continued improvements in remote off-grid systems.\nIn other countries, off-grid systems have faced the challenge of ongoing maintenance costs. China addressed this by covering them with the nationwide renewable energy fund. It collects 1.5 cents RMB (yuan) per kilowatt hour, rising to 1.9 cents RMB per kWh in 2016 to close the funding gap created by soaring renewable generation.\nIn areas that were prohibitive to serve with any system, the government rehoused people in more hospitable terrain.\n\n\nEmbed electrification in development plans\nAs in the US and other industrialised countries, China embedded electrification within its poverty eradication strategy, mainly through the ‚ÄúInfrastructure to Every Village Project,‚Äù which covered power, roads, water, and telecoms. Electrification facilitates rural economic growth, and higher incomes leads to greater electricity use, justifying further investment in rural electrification. This feedback loop enables sustainable electricity supplies rather than relying solely on government subsidy. Like the US, this process was hastened by policy measures such as China‚Äôs ‚Äúhome appliances to the countryside‚Äù programme, which subsidised purchases of TVs, washing machines, and mobile phones.\nOf course, there is also much about China that is different from other countries.\nChina‚Äôs authoritative central government can mobilise large amounts of capital relatively easily, and bring together state-owned power firms and local officials. Less authoritative governments can find those tasks more difficult. Moving people from isolated locations, for example, is not something all countries can do, and raises important questions about justice and people‚Äôs ability to adapt.\nNonetheless, while remembering differences and potential risks, China‚Äôs achievement offers lessons and blueprints. New technologies are rapidly making off-grid systems more viable, though grid systems remain the backbone. Continued improvements such as cheaper batteries and better systems integration, could shift the balance of economic merit to off-grid solutions.\nProviding electricity for all the world‚Äôs poorest is an ambitious goal. Careful planning and coordination between different stakeholders is needed to align the desired investment, human resources, and action plans.\nIntegrating electricity access into local economic development helps ensure more sustainable electrification. This is a key lesson from electrification of the advanced industrialised nations that China‚Äôs experience reinforces.\nThis article is adapted from He and Victor (2017) co-authored paper ‚ÄúExperiences and lessons from China‚Äôs success in providing electricity for all‚Äù, and presented at the 2017 IAEE International Conference at Singapore and 2017 EIA Energy Conference.\nCheck the original post at China Dialogue.

    "text": "Abstract\nWe present an integrated model, SWITCH-China, of the Chinese power sector with which to analyze the economic and technological implications of a medium to long-term decarbonization scenario while accounting for very-short-term renewable variability. On the basis of the model and assumptions used, we find that the announced 2030 carbon peak can be achieved with a carbon price of ‚àº$40/tCO2. Current trends in renewable energy price reductions alone are insufficient to replace coal; however, an 80% carbon emission reduction by 2050 is achievable in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Target Scenario with an optimal electricity mix in 2050 including nuclear (14%), wind (23%), solar (27%), hydro (6%), gas (1%), coal (3%), and carbon capture and sequestration coal energy (26%). The co-benefits of carbon-price strategy would offset 22% to 42% of the increased electricity costs if the true cost of coal and the social cost of carbon are incorporated. In such a scenario, aggressive attention to research and both technological and financial innovation mechanisms are crucial to enabling the transition at a reasonable cost, along with strong carbon policies."

    "text": "SBU Press Release\n\nStudy Shows Huge Benefits of Transitioning Away from Coal in China\nAugust 21, 2020\nChina is the world‚Äôs largest producer and consumer of coal. A team of international scientists led by Stony Brook University‚Äôs Gang He, contend that China needs to transition away from coal to help the world achieve global decarbonization and improve the nation‚Äôs environmental and human health. In a perspective paper published in One Earth, the team outlines steps that can be taken for an albeit difficult, yet just and quicker transition away from coal.\nThe study proposes a political-socio-economic perspective targeting an integrated value chain to highlight a few overarching strategies and implementing policies accelerating China‚Äôs transition away from coal. This is different from the conventional discussion on coal transition, which usually centers on air pollution, carbon emission and competition from renewables.\n‚ÄúOur paper is an effort to include in the overall discussion the employment and social justice impacts, including environmental justice, of such a transition,‚Äù said Dr.¬†He, assistant professor in the Department of Technology and Society in the College of Engineering and Applied Sciences at Stony Brook University.\n‚ÄúThe benefits of China‚Äôs transition away from coal is huge. We estimate that the most aggressive coal-transition pathway could reduce premature death related to coal combustion by 224,000 in 2050, compared to the business-as-usual scenario,‚Äù said Dr.¬†He. ‚ÄúSimilarly, our maximum estimated reduction in water consumption, arguably the most vital of all resources, is about 4.3 billion m3 in 2050.‚Äù\nThe researchers argue that for a rapid transition away from coal, China needs to take these steps:\n\nRetire coal generating plants earlier and cancel newly planned coal projects.\nReduce the nation‚Äôs coal consumption beyond the massive power sector.\nA rapid transition presents economic and social challenges that should be met with new economic opportunities.\nAttempt to align the motivations and incentives of key business and government stakeholders, which are often not coordinated.\n\nDr.¬†He emphasizes that a successful coal transition would involve changes that must take into account the well-being and economic security of some three million people who work in coal mining-related jobs in China, as well as another 500,000 who work within the coal power industry. A just transition away from coal, the authors write, also needs to accommodate low-income groups that rely on abundant, cheap and readily available coal for basic electricity and heating service.\nTo start the transition, the authors propose the creation of a dedicated task force charged with facilitating action plans to be carried out and a process that serves the best interests of affected stakeholders and China‚Äôs diverse population."

That is how much time is left to decarbonize the world‚Äôs energy systems to limit global warming to 1.5¬∞C, according to the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report. Achieving this feat requires renewable energy systems be deployed at an unprecedented speed and scale. While daunting, the good news is that this transformation may not cost as much as many expected just a decade ago, thanks to rapid cost declines in renewable energy technologies. Solar photovoltaics (PV) is a prime example. In the last decade, the price of solar modules has dropped 88 percent, making solar cost-competitive with fossil fuels in many parts of the world.\nThis remarkable success story was made possible by the decades-long free flow of goods, talent and capital across multiple countries involved in the solar industry. But the learning processes that have led to these rapid declines are increasingly at risk from policies aimed at localizing production to within national borders and moving away from global supply chains. Such policies have become increasingly popular, in part due to supply chain disruptions experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic and, perhaps more notably, in response to the concentration of the solar PV supply chain in China, which now comprises 78% of global PV module production (see Figure¬†1).\n\n\n\nFigure¬†1: Annual solar PV cell production by origin, 2010‚Äì2021.\n\n\nWe have been studying this phenomenon for years, trying to understand the cost of erecting barriers to international cooperation when it comes to the development and deployment of low carbon energy technologies (LCETs) like solar PV. In our recent paper published in Nature, we model the cost of moving away from global supply chains for solar PV modules, concluding that tens of billions of dollars have been saved in solar deployment over the past decade thanks to global supply chains."

We then simulate a counterfactual ‚Äúnational markets‚Äù scenario, in which these countries adopt nationalistic trade policies that limit cross-border learning over the same period.\nOur results show a total of $67 billion was saved in solar deployment from 2008 to 2020 thanks to global supply chains ($24 billion, $36 billion, and $7 billion in the U.S., China, and Germany, respectively). We also estimate that under the ‚Äúnational markets‚Äù scenario, solar panel prices in 2020 would have been significantly higher‚Äî107% higher in the U.S., 83% higher in Germany, and 54% higher in China (see Figure¬†2).\n\n\n\nFigure¬†2: Comparison of estimated solar PV module prices under global versus national market scenarios in China (2007‚Äì2020), and Germany and the United States (2006‚Äì2020).\n\n\nWe also compare how these two scenarios might play out going forward. Assuming that capacity grows at a constant annual growth rate (CAGR), we estimate that solar module prices could be 20%-30% higher in 2030 than they otherwise would be if countries move to complete domestic manufacturing over a ten-year time frame."

    "text": "What About Jobs?\nWhile we focus on cost in our paper, we offer a discussion of other important issues in the solar PV industry. Jobs is a politically salient issue that is often used to motivate moving solar manufacturing to the U.S. (or another country). But this motivation is inconsistent with industry realities.\nThe National Renewable Energy Laboratory estimates that there are ten times more annual jobs in system installation compared with those in the entire manufacturing supply chain. As a result, higher module prices associated with nationalistic policies could lead to lower total deployment, costing potentially thousands more jobs than those gained in manufacturing, which is highly automated in most modern module manufacturing plants.\nThis reality has already played out under the tariffs on imported solar PV modules from China, which have been in place over the past three U.S. administrations. The Solar Energy Industries Association estimated that Section 201 tariffs implemented under the Trump administration has cost the industry 60,000 jobs, and if new tariffs are added that number could rise to 100,000. Lowering or completely removing these tariffs would almost certainly accelerate solar deployment (and job growth) in the U.S., especially with the tax credit incentives put in place under the Inflation Reduction Act."

    "text": "What About Diversification?\nReliance on a single set of countries in critical supply chains introduces risks to global disruptions, and a diversified solar PV manufacturing base can provide a layer of resilience. A related article in Science, Davidson et al. (2022) provides a framework for balancing the economic and national security risks from decoupling from China in mature and emerging low-carbon technologies. Nonetheless, it is also important to consider the risks associated with continued dependence on fossil fuels for energy. While fossil energy prices are highly susceptible to global disruptions, renewable energy systems have no fuel cost. Furthermore, a dependency now on a country like China for solar panels may not exist forever as manufacturing can shift over time; in contrast, fossil energy sources are geographically fixed, limiting potential future trade partners.\nOf course, countries may choose to diversify for ethical reasons too. The Xinjiang region of China has been come under increased scrutiny from allegations of forced labor. Most of the world‚Äôs solar-grade polysilicon is produced in Xinjiang, and policies such as the Biden Administration‚Äôs Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act are aimed at limiting trade with products made in this region. The solar industry has responded with proposed protocols for tracing upstream material supplies, which is an initial step in addressing the issue, but more needs to be done."

Global trade will be critical for scaling up the deployment of these technologies all over the world. While efforts to boost domestic manufacturing of and demand for renewable energy technologies are steps in the right direction, we must not lose site of the timeline left to decarbonize. Erecting barriers to the free flow of goods, talent, and capital in LCET sectors will limit the ability to address the looming climate crisis.\nThis does not mean the U.S. should abandon solar manufacturing. The world will need more supply to meet the scale of deployment necessary for climate goals, and more solar manufacturers adds resiliency to disruptive events such as pandemics and conflicts. As an R&D leader, the U.S. could very likely lead in developing (and potentially manufacturing) the next-generation of solar PV technology. But the U.S. should not penalize firms for buying low-cost, high-quality panels from abroad, not when cost is still a barrier to greater solar adoption.\nThere is a Chinese idiom that has a close corollary in the English-speaking world: ÂêåËàüÂÖ±Êµé(t√≥ng zh≈çu g√≤ng j√¨), which roughly translates to ‚Äúsame boat, work together.‚Äù Time is not on our side.

    "text": "Abstract\nChina is pursuing the development of low-carbon eco-cities to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases emissions; however, it is unclear what constitutes a low-carbon eco-city and how to evaluate it. The eco and low-carbon indicator tool for evaluating cities (ELITE cities) was developed by researchers at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in 2012 to evaluate cities‚Äô performance by comparing them against benchmark performance goals as well as rank them against other cities in China. ELITE cities measures progress on 33 key indicators selected to represent priority issues within eight primary categories. An excel-based tool was then developed to package the key indicators, indicator benchmarks, explanation of indicators, point calculation functions and transparency-oriented data recording instructions. ELITE cities could be a useful and effective tool for local city government in defining the broad outlines of a low-carbon eco-city and assessing the progress of cities‚Äô efforts towards this goal. ELITE cities can also be used by higher-level governments to assess city performance and discern best practices. This paper explains the general framework of the ELITE cities tool, the methods by which the indicators and indicator benchmarks were established, and a detailed guide on tool applications."

A new study led by Stony Brook University and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory analyses the cost of renewable energy in China and reveals that costs are projected to decline further, thereby bringing new possibilities for the widespread penetration of renewable energy and extensive power-sector decarbonization. The findings, published in Nature Communications, may serve as a model for the United States and worldwide illustrating that decreases in renewable costs may help drive clean energy growth.\nPrevious studies and reports globally have not adequately captured the dramatic decrease in costs of renewable energy and storage and therefore have underestimated the development of renewables. The authors contend that incorporating the new downward trend in costs of renewable energy into models is invaluable for modeling scenarios that are required for developing appropriate energy policies in countries.\n‚ÄúFor too long relying on variable wind and solar resources for electricity generation has been considered a challenge to system operations and as having no economic advantage,‚Äù said Gang He, Assistant Professor in the Department of Technology and Society in the College of Engineering and Applied Sciences at Stony Brook University.\n‚ÄúNow rapid technological developments and falling costs in renewable energy and storage are undermining this assumption. Our paper is an effort to reveal the implications of such changes for China‚Äôs clean power transition.‚Äù\nGlobal weighted-average cost of electricity of utility-scale solar PV, onshore wind, and battery storage in China plummeted by 77, 35, and 85 percent, respectively, between 2010 and 2018. The researchers incorporated these falling costs into models for the development of China‚Äôs power sector, a factor often overlooked in power sector modelling.\nThe modelling showed four scenarios for China‚Äôs power sector up to 2030, the business as usual approach, low cost renewable use, carbon constraints, and deep carbon constraints. Their findings with the models revealed that if cost trends continue, 62 percent of China‚Äôs electricity would come from non-fossil sources by 2030 at a cost that is 11 percent lower than achieved through a business-as-usual approach.\nThe authors emphasize that expansion of renewables under the low-cost scenario would require significant infrastructure support in the form of transmission lines and storage capacity to allow grid stability.\n‚ÄúThe large-scale decarbonization of the power sector requires that several processes take place simultaneously,‚Äù explains Dr.¬†He. ‚ÄúBoth the renewable and storage capacity and transmission infrastructure must be scaled up quickly. The investment needed for the infrastructure transformation must be acquired and dedicated. And social and economic equity must be addressed during the transition to lower carbon power systems.‚Äù\nIf such processes can be achieved simultaneously, added Dr.¬†He, China will be able to increase renewables in an increasingly cost-effective manner. Such a model may show that fast decarbonization is both technically feasible and economically beneficial, a scenario that offers the prospect of large emissions mitigation with a global environmental impact.\nThe research was supported by the Energy Foundation China, and the Hewlett and MJS Foundation through the U.S. Department of Energy under Contract Number No.¬†DE-AC02-05CH11231."

The project is led by Principal Investigators (PI) Professors David Tonjes and Elizabeth Hewitt, Co-PI Professor Gang He, and Research Professor Krista Thyberg. The primary task is to sample a set of municipal waste systems statewide to determine the composition of managed wastes and recyclables.\nProfessor Tonjes has worked on New York solid waste issues for 30 years, in both technical and policy applications. Professor Hewitt is a planner with a strong background in researching human behavior and motivations in environmental settings. Professor He has conducted extensive research on recent energy and environmental management in China in terms of both infrastructure and policy changes. Professor Thyberg has been working on solid waste issues for about 10 years, including iconic work on managing food waste. They will be supported by teams of graduate students enrolled in doctoral and masters programs in the Department, and undergraduate students drawn mostly from the Technological Systems Management major.\nStudent teams get the job of sorting garbage into more than 20 categories to determine variations across the State and within different kinds of management programs. Data will provide characterizations at a variety of scales, from individual truck routes to the State as a whole. The first year‚Äôs work, which was impacted by the pandemic, was restricted to sorting wastes at a number of recycling facilities and at two Long Island locations. The students found time during lock down to assemble data from nearly 200 waste sorts done by others across the country over the past several decades to put the New York work into context.\n‚ÄúSimilarities and differences across data sets will help refine State policies and regulations regarding solid waste management,‚Äù said Tonjes, associate research professor in the Department of Technology & Society in Stony Brook‚Äôs College of Engineering and Applied Sciences (CEAS). ‚ÄúOur ultimate goal is to enable municipal waste managers to better target recovery and other management efforts while leading to refined or new means to promote more environmentally favorable behaviors.‚Äù\nThis summer the sampling teams will fan out across the State and analyze samples at a number of disposal and recycling facilities. The data will not only be used to measure the effectiveness and efficiency of current programs but also to support other NYSDEC-funded recycling research programs, including work at the New York State Pollution Prevention Institute in Rochester, the University at Buffalo, SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry, and Alfred University.\nYear one also saw the completion of other related research projects supported by the NYSDEC grant by two smaller teams of student researchers:\n\nThe first created an interactive web-based model to allow local planners to determine which materials are economically favored for recycling. This will allow for potential expansion of municipal recycling menus in sustainable directions. The model has been created and tested, and now the project report is being finalized for release later this spring.\nThe second project investigated the interplay between market specifications and economics, recycling facility engineering choices, and policies adopted in China and by other jurisdictions that affect recycling. In 2017-2018, these factors merged to catastrophically collapse global recyclables markets. This research has explored the drivers for these intertwined forces and will help those proposing recycling regulations and planning technology implementations to mitigate the potential for similar events, and potentially to provide direction for recyclables processing for more long-term market sustainability. The reports detailing the findings are being prepared and will also be available in Spring 2021.\nA third related recycling research project will analyze the principles of the ‚Äúcircular economy‚Äù and determine the potential for recycling (especially ‚Äúfirst order‚Äù recycling, which is when old newspaper is turned into new newspaper, not toilet paper, for instance) to play an important role in creating sustainable materials management. The project will focus on the classic set of recyclable materials (newspaper, cardboard, glass, metals, plastics) to determine what kinds of factors may limit first order recycling, which can lead to better expectations for market development and pursuit of innovative uses of collected materials destined for reuse. This project has just started and is expected to take two years to complete.\n\n‚ÄúThe Department of Technology & Society blends engineering principles with social responsibility to help ensure that advances in technology truly benefit the community,‚Äù said Robert Kukta, acting dean, CEAS. ‚ÄúWith population growth and increasing waste production, effective recycling is a critical issue for global sustainability. This project is a large step in the right direction not only for New York, but as a model for other locales.‚Äù"

    "text": "Abstract\nAchieving carbon neutrality requires deploying renewable energy at unprecedented speed and scale, yet countries sometimes implement policies that increase costs by restricting the free flow of capital, talent and innovation in favour of localizing benefits such as economic growth, employment and trade surpluses. Here we assess the cost savings from a globalized solar photovoltaic (PV) module supply chain. We develop a two-factor learning model using historical capacity, component and input material price data of solar PV deployment in the United States, Germany and China. We estimate that the globalized PV module market has saved PV installers US$24 (19‚Äì31) billion in the United States, US$7 (5‚Äì9) billion in Germany and US$36 (26‚Äì45) billion in China from 2008 to 2020 compared with a counterfactual scenario where domestic manufacturers supply an increasing proportion of installed capacities over a ten-year period. Projecting the same scenario forwards from 2020 results in estimated solar module prices that are approximately 20‚Äì30 per cent higher in 2030 compared with a future with globalized supply chains. International climate policy benefits from a globalized low-carbon value chain, and these results point to the need for complementary policies to mitigate welfare distribution effects and potential impacts on technological crowding out."

    "text": "Abstract\nThis study was aimed at evaluating the inhibitory effects of the phytochemicals from the Cannabis sativa (Cannabis) leaf extracts against Alzheimer‚Äôs disease (AD) protein targets. Twelve compounds derived from the Cannabis sativa leaf extracts were evaluated as potential inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), dopa decarboxylase (DDC), serotonin receptor 2C (HTR2C) and monoamine oxidase (MAO). Ligand-based and receptor-ligand complex were used to derive the pharmacophore hypothesis. In silico study through molecular docking simulation method was adopted to analyze the inhibitory activity of the compounds in question. Molecular dynamic simulation (MDs) was performed to assess the stability of the top-ranked phytochemicals. The binding energies of these compounds to the four targets were investigated by the Molecular Mechanics for the Generalized Born Model and Solvent Accessibility method (MM-GBSA). The binding-free energy suggests that cannabinol, cannabichromene, linoelaidic acid and morphinan-6-one can be utilized as lead compounds in drug discovery and development of AD to inhibit activity of AChE, DCC gene, MAO and HTR2C. The MDs indicated that AChE-Cannabinol, DCC-Cannabicoumaronone, MAO-Linoelaidic acid, and HTR2C-morphinan-6-one were stable over the entire course of 100 ns suggesting their role in the regulation of the diseases in which their respective receptors are implicated."

This rapid fall in costs could have a large effect on energy system investment and policies, but has not been fully captured in energy modelling.\nThis is particularly relevant for China, which is now debating whether to build hundreds of new coal-fired power plants in the 2020s, despite overcapacity and financial distress in the sector.\nIn a new study, published in Nature Communications, we worked with my colleagues to explore the implications of clean-energy cost trends for the electricity system in China over the next decade.\nWe found that if China uses the most cost-effective renewable energy resources, it could generate more than 60% of its electricity from ‚Äúnon-fossil‚Äù sources by 2030 ‚Äì including wind, solar, hydro and nuclear ‚Äì at a cost that is around 10% lower than under business-as-usual.\nThis cleaner electricity mix would still reliably meet rising demand. This suggests China could raise its target to get 50% of its electricity from non-fossil sources by 2030, while saving money."

    "text": "Balancing priorities\nIt is often said that renewable sources of electricity, such as wind and solar, are variable and expensive. However, the recent innovation in technology and operation of electricity grids ‚Äì and, in particular, the availability of cheaper storage ‚Äì have changed the industry outlook.\nIn this study, we used an electricity system capacity expansion model (SWITCH-China) to explore how the Chinese power system could be expanded to meet rising electricity demand. We developed four scenarios for 2030 to explore the implications of a continued, rapid decrease in renewable energy costs.\nThe scenarios are:\n\nBusiness-as-usual scenario (BAU), which assumes the continuation of current policies and moderate cost decreases in future renewable costs;\nLow-cost renewables scenario (R), which assumes the rapid recent decrease in costs for renewables and storage will continue;\nCarbon constraints scenario (C50), which has a power-sector carbon cap of 50% below 2015 levels in 2030, on top of the R scenario;\nDeep carbon constraints scenario (C80), which further constrain the carbon emissions from the power sector to be 80% lower than the 2015 level by 2030.\n\nAll scenarios assume the same electricity demand projection, which reaches 8,757 terawatt hours (TWh) in 2030, up from 7,225TWh today.\nOur modeling results show that, as expected, rapid decreases in the costs of renewable energy sources lead to more wind and solar capacity being installed. If the levelised cost of energy (LCOE) for solar, wind and storage follows recent global trends then, by 2030, China could meet expected demand with 62% of its electricity from non-fossil sources under the R scenario with the lowest overall cost.\nThis ‚ÄúR‚Äù scenario is shown in Figure¬†1, in the second column on the right-hand side, with wind (green) and solar (yellow) providing 39% of the total. As a result of higher non-fossil output, coal-based generation (black) could be just 3,700TWh in 2030 under the R scenario, some 30% lower than under BAU (4,900TWh). Battery storage (orange) and small amounts of gas (purple) generation would supplement the increasing wind and solar supplies.\n\n\n\nFigure¬†1: Electricity generation by fuel, terawatt hours, in 2020 (left), 2025 (centre) and 2030 (right), under each of the four modelled scenarios.

In our scenarios, it is estimated to reach up to 130GW by 2030, with the remaining 177GW coming from battery storage or other storage technology.\nThis large capacity would be very ambitious to deploy in a comparatively short time, requiring about 11.8GW annually during the period we modelled. If battery efficiency and performance were to improve more quickly than we assumed, the needed storage capacity would be smaller."

    "text": "Clean energy transition and post-Covid recovery\nAs China drafts its 14th five-year plan (due next year) and deliberates its own post-Covid economic recovery measures, our research offers valuable insights into the cheapest ways to meet the country‚Äôs rising electricity demand.\nMost notably, we found that China could cut emissions from its power sector at lower overall cost than a business-as-usual approach, by relying more heavily on renewables and storage. This would have co-benefits including reducing harmful air pollution, cutting water use and creating green jobs.\nIn contrast, there are signs that some local governments are fast-tracking more new coal power plants this year, despite the fact that half of China‚Äôs existing capacity is already losing money and the entire fleet only operates half the time, a sign of overcapacity.\nWhile it should save money overall, the scale of the transformation implied by our work is significant and would require a very rapid acceleration of current progress. The capacity of renewables and storages, as well as transmission infrastructure, would need to be scaled up very quickly.\nNevertheless, our analysis shows that such a fast decarbonisation and clean power transition is both technically feasible and economically beneficial.\nOptions to bring such a transition about could include long-term targets for clean energy, such as a zero-emission power target, as well as electricity market reforms. This could create incentives to reduce institutional barriers to trading power across regions and to better integrate renewable energy.\nCheck the original post at Carbon Brief.

This rapid growth has been the result of a domestic manufacturing base and favorable national policies. Further evolution will be greatly aided with a detailed wind resource assessment that incorporates spatial and temporal variability across China. We utilized 200 representative locations for which 10 years of hourly wind speed data exist to develop provincial capacity factors from 2001 to 2010, and to build analytic wind speed profiles. From these data and analysis we find that China◊≥s annual wind generation could reach 2000 TWh to 3500 TWh. Nationally this would correspond to an average capacity factor of 0.18. The diurnal and seasonal variation shows spring and winter has better wind resources than in the summer and fall. A highly interconnected and coordinated power system is needed to effectively exploit this large but variable resource. A full economic assessment of exploitable wind resources demands a larger, systems-level analysis of China‚Äôs energy options, for which this work is a core requirement."

    "section": "Remarks",
    "text": "Remarks\nThank you, Jessica, for the nice introduction.\nLet me start by congratulating Dr.¬†Cui and the team for the release of such an important and timely report. I want to echo what Prof.¬†Yuan have just shown the implications of China‚Äôs coal transition. The report lays down a ground break work to identify low hanging fruits of coal plants retirement and shows a feasible strategy to phase down coal power in China.\nI hope to add a few comments focusing on renewables. You may curious this is coal phase down event, why am I talking about renewables. Here is the thing, it‚Äôs good to phase down coal, then where will our electricity come from? The answer is: non-fossil sources, especially renewables! My rationale is that the more we can provide stable and secure renewables supply, the less we will rely on coal, and the better chance we can successfully phase down coal.\nFirst, China‚Äôs clean power transition needs two accelerations at the same time. While accelerating phase down of coal, we will need to accelerate renewable development and integration. Renewables will need to first feed all the new demand and then to replace coal. Let‚Äôs be real, coal generation is still growing, good news is the share of renewables grows too. In 2021, coal accounts about 62% of total generation, hydro about 16%, nuclear 5%, wind 8%, and solar 4%. Renewables (hydro, wind, and solar) overtook coal in new capacity in 2013, and renewable combined exceeded 50% of the new capacity in 2016, and in 2021, 78% of the new capacity are renewables. According to the latest data from the National Energy Administration, by the end of 2021, the country‚Äôs installed wind and solar capacity both exceeded 300 GW, wind 328GW and solar 306GW. To achieve carbon neutrality goal, we need 10x today‚Äôs solar and wind capacity by mid-century, that‚Äôs the scale of acceleration we are talking here.\nSecond, cheap renewables are a game changer, a renewable dominant path is not just technical feasible, but also cost effective, and with water saving and other co-benefits. This chart from Our World in Data shows that from 2009 to 2019 the cost of PV fell by 90 percent, onshore wind by 70%, and concentrated solar by 16%. The learning rate reaches 36% for PV and 23% for onshore wind, meaning that for every doubling of cumulative installed capacity, the cost of PV fell 36% and onshore wind 23%. 2021 can be described as the tipping point of grid parity or we say, ‚Äúlow-cost renewable era‚Äù. In China, the National Development and Reform Commission, canceled the subsidized tariff for new central PV and onshore wind projects, a milestone for renewables. The arrival of grid parity, relative to the 2000 forecast, about 50 years ahead of time; relative to the 2010 forecast, about 30 years ahead of time; relative to the 2015 forecast, about 10 years ahead of time. The early arrival of grid parity accelerates the development of renewable energy and opens new possibilities for achieving carbon neutrality to confront climate change.\nIn a collaborative Nature Communications paper with Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, we found that if the current trend of declining renewables costs continues, by 2030, wind and solar could provide 39% of electricity generation, together with hydro (14%) and nuclear (10%), the share of non-fossil electricity could be 62%, compared to 50% commonly discussed. What‚Äôs more, it will be 11% cheaper than in the reference scenario. Wind and solar together could exceed 1800GW of capacity, compared to the 1200GW national goal. In another collaborative paper with Tongji University, we find cheap renewables reduces the need for carbon capture and storage by 80% in 2050 and saves water consumption for cooling by 10 billion cubic meters annually compared with the reference scenario.\nThird, coal could play a facilitator‚Äôs role in integrating renewables, coal needs to reposition or repurpose itself from cornerstone to stepstone in clean power transition. Flexibility retrofitting and converting coal plants to reserved capacity could help to address the flexibility challenges in a renewable dominant grid, even though coal flexibility‚Äôs contribution to renewable integration is marginal comparing to building national electricity market and dispersed renewable investments, accordingly to a collaborative paper with LBL published in iScience.\nIn summary, accelerating coal transition and renewable development needs to go hand in hand, and renewable achieving grid parity not just make this technical feasible, but also economic effective, and coal could reposition and repurpose itself from footstone to stepstone in clean power transition."

    "text": "Testimony Transcript\n\nTestimony of Dr.¬†Gang He\nBefore the New York State Senate Environmental Conservation Committee Public Hearing on the Climate and Community Protection Act‚ÄîS.2992/A.3876 February 15, 2019‚ÄîMineola, New York\nSenator Todd Kaminsky, and members of the Committee on Environmental Conservation, I am very pleased to have the opportunity to testify before the committee. I appreciate the attention your committee is giving to the vital issues of greenhouse gas emissions reduction and clean energy.\nI‚Äôm an assistant professor in the Department of Technology and Society at Stony Brook University. My research focuses on energy system modeling, energy economic, energy and climate policy.\n\n\nRenewable energy is achieving global momentum\nThe costs of solar photovoltaics (PV), wind, and battery storage have fallen by approximately 65% to 85% since 2010 and are projected to decline further in the near future‚Äîcreating opportunities for deep decarbonization in the power sector and energy systems. According to the latest report from Green Tech Media Research, U.S. Residential Solar Economic Outlook: Grid Parity, Rate Design and Net Metering Risk, 20 U.S. states are currently at grid parity, including in New York.\n\n\nNew York‚Äôs opportunity to keep leadership in clean energy and climate action\nNew York State has an opportunity to lead in clean energy and climate action by introducing and implementing the renewable energy development and carbon mitigation targets. California, for example, is on the path and pace to achieve goals to reduce GHG to 40% below 1990 levels by 2030, benefit from a series of supporting policies1, including:\n\nA renewable energy portfolio standard (RPS) to increase renewable electricity production to 60% by 2030;\n\nA low-carbon fuel standard to reduce the carbon intensity of transportation fuels by 20 percent by 2030;\n\nAnd efficiency standards in building, appliance, water and others to double energy efficiency savings at existing buildings;\n\nSuite of other energy and climate policies to facilitate the transition.\n\nIn addition to California, New Jersey (50 percent by 2030), Connecticut (40 percent by 2030) and Massachusetts (35 percent by 2030) all adopted stronger targets for renewable energy, accelerating their states‚Äô transitions away from fossil fuels and toward to a clean energy future. New York State has to choose to lead, or fall behind.\n\n\nGreen jobs and economic benefits\nSuch clean energy transition is not only generating renewable energy and reducing carbon emissions, but also creating jobs and economic benefits to New York State and local communities. My research group has worked with the offshore wind industry, to estimate the jobs and economic impact of offshore wind projects in New York State. We estimated that a typical 800MW offshore wind project could create more than 3000 direct and indirect clean full-time equivalent energy jobs and bring nearly 700 million economic impact to the New York State. About 40 percent of the jobs will be in Long Island area. Work in the Long Island region includes cable and converter station connections, and work on the onshore substation. There will also jobs related R&D spending, and community development.\n\n\nPaving the road for 21st century economic competitiveness\nEnergy technology innovation, together with other emerging technologies such as AI, big data, internet of things, block chain, and their applications to clean energy sector, are building the next frontiers of economic development and competition. The clean energy workforce, and the education of next generation energy leaders are the new pillars to support a sustainable future for New York State.\nThe key message I‚Äôd like to share is that leadership in clean energy development and climate action present an economic opportunity for New York State. The job creation and economic benefits through clean energy innovation and investment is a true opportunity, and New York could harvest those benefit as an earlier mover.\nThe transcprit is also available in pdf."

We found some key experiences and lessons to be learned from China‚Äôs successful program to provide electricity for all. Substantial funding from the central government, delivered by mechanisms sensitive to local provincial needs, were essential to success. Also vital was use of off-grid solar home systems for the most remote users for whom grid connection would be quite costly."

    "text": "Full Response\nQ: China, as we know has a long-term plan to increase the proportion of nuclear energy into its energy mix. What are the advantages and risks of such ambition?\nA: Energy strategy and policy are about trade-offs and fit in specific conditions and constraints. The political economy dynamics of different energy technologies will have a large impact on the outcomes.\nFrom my research, China‚Äôs future power system will be quite sensitive to how much nuclear can China put online. I have seen 2050 nuclear projections and plans range from about 300GW to 500GW, this 200GW differences will need about 800-1000GW more wind and solar capacity to fill the gap, as nuclear plants can run at 90% capacity factor with little or no impact from weather. However, if China manages to accelerate the expansion and integration of solar, wind, and other renewables, then the need for nuclear will be reduced to its lower end, with less pressure on nuclear risks and nuclear waste management.\nWe will see renewables and nuclear expand hand in hand in the short term to achieve carbon peak and carbon neutrality in the medium and long-term, but the comparative scale will be shaped by the changing political economy of those technologies."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nThe clean development mechanism (CDM) has been a leading international carbon market and a driving force for sustainable development. But the eruption of controversy over offsets from Chinese wind power in 2009 exposed cracks at the core of how carbon credits are verified in the developing economies. The Chinese wind controversy therefore has direct implications for the design and negotiation of any successor to the Kyoto Protocol or future market-based carbon regimes. In order for carbon markets to avoid controversy and function effectively, the lessons from the Chinese wind controversy should be used to implement key reforms in current and future carbon policy design. The paper examines the application of additionality in the Chinese wind power market and draws implications for the design of effective global carbon offset policy. It demonstrates the causes of the wind power controversy, highlights underlying structural flaws, in how additionality is applied in China, the Offsetters‚Äô Paradox, and charts a reform path that can strengthen the credibility of global carbon markets."

    "text": "Abstract\nThe deployment of renewable energy sources, power-to-gas (P2G) systems, and zero-emission vehicles provide a synergistic opportunity to accelerate the decarbonization of both power and transportation system. This article investigates the prospects of implementing hydrogen P2G technology in coupling the power system and the transportation system. A novel coordinated long-term planning model of integrated power and transportation system (IPTS) at the regional scale is proposed to simulate the power system balance and travel demand balance simultaneously, while subject to a series of constraints, such as CO2 emission constraints. IPTS of Texas was investigated considering various CO2 emission cap scenarios. Results show unique decarbonization trajectories of the proposed coordinated planning model, in which IPTS prefers to decarbonizing the power sector firstly. When the power system reaches ultralow carbon intensity, the IPTS then focuses on the road transportation system decarbonization. The results show that with the P2G system, IPTS of Texas could achieve 100% CO2 emission reductions (relative 2018 emissions level) by adding a combination of approximately 143.5 GW of wind, 50 GW of solar PV, and 40 GW of P2G systems with 2.5% renewables curtailment. The integration of the P2G system can produce hydrogen by use of surplus RES generation to meet hydrogen demand of Fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) and to meet multiday electricity supply imbalances."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nNucleopeptides are a class of molecules with numerous applications in the field of therapy, diagnostics and biomaterials development. Despite their nucleobase-decorated nature, their binding to natural nucleic acid targets does not necessarily involve all nucleopeptide bases, as we showed in this study. Here, we present a CD study on the interaction of a dithymine-functionalized tetra-L-serine with a homoadenine DNA (dA12) reporting an interpretation of the experimental data in light of our computational studies based on molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD), as well as computer-assisted CD interpretation and simulation of the predicted complex structure. The stoichiometry of the complex, emerged by CD titration, accounted for a 1:2 T:A ratio. Hence, we supposed that binding did not involve a full pairing of the complementary bases but a partial thymines engagement. This hypothesis was sustained by the docking and MD simulations performed on the selected ligand and the complementary target of DNA and RNA, used for comparison. The nucleopeptide bound the DNA through a single A-T recognition involving complementary base-pairing, as well as by some interactions between its backbone (and in particular L-serine OH) and the nucleic acid. Overall, this confirmed that nucleopeptides can interact with nucleic acids leaving some of their nucleobases free for establishing further interactions with other biomolecules or for crosslinking in supramolecular structures in aqueous solution. Nevertheless, even though no typical DNA secondary structure is formed after nucleopeptide-binding, this ligand is able to induce a higher degree of structuration in the random deoxyoligonucleotide target as evidenced by CD, MD and CD simulation."

    "text": "Abstract\nThe COVID-19 (Corona Virus Disease 19) pandemic caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is causing enormous difficulties in the worlds economies and there is uncertainty as to whether the current prophylactic measures will offer adequate protection globally after the appearance of virus variants that like that indicated as Omicron emerged in the presence of global vaccine-based immunization. While several studies are available describing the main differences in the spike protein of Omicron compared to the other variants previously emerged there was no structural insights into the 3CL-protease (3CLpro) associated to the new variant. Herein we performed a computational study based on genomic data and amino acid sequences available in the most updated COVID-19-related databases that allowed us to build up in silico the 3D structure of Omicron 3CLpro. Moreover by molecular dynamics simulation we demonstrated that currently available drugs acting as inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease could be less effective in the case of Omicron variant due to the different chemical interactions in the binding site occurred after the recent amino acid mutations. Ultimately our study highlights the need of exploiting in silico and in vitro methods to discover novel 3CLpro inhibitors starting from the computationally based structure we presented herein and more in general to direct the major efforts to targeting the most conserved 3CLpro regions that appeared unchanged in the context of the Omicron variant."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nThis study was aimed at evaluating the inhibitory effects of the phytochemicals from the Cannabis sativa (Cannabis) leaf extracts against Alzheimer‚Äôs disease (AD) protein targets. Twelve compounds derived from the Cannabis sativa leaf extracts were evaluated as potential inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), dopa decarboxylase (DDC), serotonin receptor 2C (HTR2C) and monoamine oxidase (MAO). Ligand-based and receptor-ligand complex were used to derive the pharmacophore hypothesis. In silico study through molecular docking simulation method was adopted to analyze the inhibitory activity of the compounds in question. Molecular dynamic simulation (MDs) was performed to assess the stability of the top-ranked phytochemicals. The binding energies of these compounds to the four targets were investigated by the Molecular Mechanics for the Generalized Born Model and Solvent Accessibility method (MM-GBSA). The binding-free energy suggests that cannabinol, cannabichromene, linoelaidic acid and morphinan-6-one can be utilized as lead compounds in drug discovery and development of AD to inhibit activity of AChE, DCC gene, MAO and HTR2C. The MDs indicated that AChE-Cannabinol, DCC-Cannabicoumaronone, MAO-Linoelaidic acid, and HTR2C-morphinan-6-one were stable over the entire course of 100 ns suggesting their role in the regulation of the diseases in which their respective receptors are implicated."

    "text": "Abstract\nBackground T-box family members are transcription factors characterized by highly conserved residues corresponding to the DNA-binding domain known as the T-box. TBX2 has been implicated in several developmental processes, such as coordinating cell fate, patterning, and morphogenesis of a wide range of tissues and organs, including lungs, limbs, heart, kidneys, craniofacial structures, and mammary glands.\nMethods In the present study, we have clinically and genetically characterized a proband showing a severe form of chondrodysplasia with developmental delay. Whole-exome sequencing (WES), Sanger sequencing, and 3D protein modeling were performed in the present investigation.\nResults Whole-exome sequencing revealed a novel nonsense variant (c.529A&gt;T; p.Lys177*; NM_005994.4) in TBX2. 3D-TBX2 protein modeling revealed a substantial reduction of the mutated protein, which might lead to a loss of function (LOF) or nonsense-mediated decay (NMD).\nConclusion This study has not only expanded the mutation spectrum in the gene TBX2 but also facilitated the diagnosis and genetic counseling of related features in affected families."

    "title": "Importation of SARS-CoV-2 Variant B.1.1.7 in Pakistan",
    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nOn December 14, 2020, a variant of SARS‚ÄêCoV‚Äê2 characterized as VOC‚Äê202012/01 (lineage B.1.1.7) emerged in the United Kingdom with rapid expansion to over 64 countries as of January 27, 2021. (https://www.gisaid.org/). Analysis of 17,782 whole‚Äêgenome sequences submitted to GISAID exhibited several mutations mainly in the spike (S) gene. During the current COVID‚Äê19 pandemic, identification of novel lineages of SARS‚ÄêCoV‚Äê2 and tracking their geographic spread are essential to guide public health interventions and travel advice. We hereby report the detection and genetic characterization of two imported cases of the B.1.1.7 variant in Pakistan.\nThe oropharyngeal swabs of travelers returning from United Kingdom were tested for the presence of SARS‚ÄêCoV‚Äê2 through real‚Äêtime polymerase chain reaction (PCR) at the Department of Virology, National Institute of Health, Pakistan. Briefly, viral RNA was extracted using QIAamp Viral RNA Mini kit (Qiagen) according to manufacturer‚Äôs instructions. A two‚Äêstep strategy was used for the detection of the SARS‚ÄêCoV‚Äê2 variant B.1.1.7 with initial screening by TaqPath‚Ñ¢ RT‚ÄêPCR COVID‚Äê19 kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) followed by whole genome sequencing of spike gene target failure (SGTF) samples. The NEBNext Ultra II Directional RNA Library Prep kit for Illumina (NEW ENGLAND BioLabs Inc.) was used for library preparation according to manufacturer‚Äôs instructions and whole‚Äêgenome sequencing was performed on Illumina iSeq 100 instrument (Illumina). Sequence alignment and analysis was performed using Geneious prime software version 2020.1.2 (https://www.geneious.com/prime/).\nBetween December 28, 2020 and January 03, 2021, a total of 76 samples from travelers returning from the United Kingdom were received and tested among which 38 (50%) were found SARS‚ÄêCoV‚Äê2 positive on real‚Äêtime PCR (showing amplification of all three targets, i.e., N gene, ORF1ab and the S gene) whereas 10 (26%) samples showed the SGTF. Only six SGTF samples having low Ct values of N gene (&lt;25) were further subjected to next generation sequencing and two samples were successfully sequenced.\nThe two Pakistan strains MU‚ÄêNIH‚ÄêK14 and MU‚ÄêNIH‚ÄêK53 showed 99.9% nucleotide homology with the UK prototype variant (VOC‚Äê202012/01). Phylogenetic analysis categorized Pakistani strains to B.1.1.7 lineage indicating two independent introductions that clustered with strains from Luxembourg, Spain, and United States, respectively (Figure¬†1). Overall, the two strains showed 19 missense mutations, 6 amino acid deletions, and 5 synonymous mutations (Table¬†1). Notably, we found the N501Y mutation in the receptor binding domain of spike protein known to escalate viral binding with angiotensin‚Äêconverting enzyme 2 receptor, increase transmissibility and enables the virus to escape class 1 antibodies.\n\n\n\nPhylogenetic tree of B.1.1.7 variant viruses. For phylogenetic analysis, Wuhan reference SARS‚ÄêCoV‚Äê2 (EPI_ISL_529213) sequence and whole genome sequences of B.1.1.7 SARS‚ÄêCoV‚Äê2 strain deposited on GISAID till January 8, 2021 were downloaded followed by multiple sequence alignment using MAFTT. The phylogenetic tree was constructed using BEAST to estimate divergence times. The Pakistani sequences are highlighted in green color. The tree was edited and visualized using Figtree software (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/). A timescale for evolution of strain is shown at the bottom of tree. Complete genome sequences of SARS‚ÄêCoV‚Äê2 B.1.1.7 strains (MU‚ÄêNIH‚ÄêK14 & MU‚ÄêNIH‚ÄêK53) are deposited at the GISAID having accession ID‚Äôs EPI_ISL_757258 and EPI_ISL_757286\n\n\nOur sequences MU‚ÄêNIH‚ÄêK14 and MU‚ÄêNIH‚ÄêK53 also showed a spike protein P618H substitution reported as a key determinant for efficient SARS‚ÄêCoV‚Äê2 transmission and deletion at amino acid 69‚Äì70 that has implications for diagnostic assays.\nWhilst the full implication and functional significance of such variants is yet to be determined, these findings warrant to scale‚Äêup the molecular surveillance system in Pakistan to enable early detection of emerging lineages and their clinical impact. As of to date, there is a single public health federal institute (NIH) resourced to characterize SARS‚ÄêCoV‚Äê2 variants. The national authorities should proactively focus on expanding genomic surveillance of SARS‚ÄêCoV‚Äê2 to fortify global containment efforts in identifying epidemiologically and clinically significant variants and track their transmission lineages for effective countermeasures.\nNotably, Pakistan has yet to devise its vaccination strategy using an economical and community acceptable vaccine before the immunization kicks off in the country. Pakistan, since September 2020, is conducting a phase‚ÄêIII clinical trial of a single‚Äêdose anti‚ÄêCOVID vaccine manufactured by a Chinese producer CanSino with 18,000 volunteers mainly in the Federal capital. Another phase‚ÄêI trial of a different Chinese vaccine SinoVac has been completed in district Karachi. With such encouraging decisions by the Government of Pakistan to boost the herd immunity and protection through vaccination preferably through a Chinese manufacturer, alarming news came out of a phase‚ÄêIII trial of the Chinese Coronavac vaccine in Brazil with only 50% efficacy compared to western counterparts, that is, Moderna and Pfizer‚ÄêBioNTech with 95% efficacy. It is, therefore, critical to reconsider the selection of vaccine to win public acceptance at large in view of the chronic reluctance impeding polio eradication in the country for years."

    "text": "Abstract\nRecent studies highlight the effectiveness of hybrid Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines combining wild-type nucleocapsid and Spike proteins. We have further enhanced this strategy by incorporating delta and omicron variants‚Äô spike protein mutations. Both delta and omicron mark the shifts in viral transmissibility and severity in unvaccinated and vaccinated patients. So their mutations are highly crucial for future viral variants also. Omicron is particularly adept at immune evasion by mutating spike epitopes. The rapid adaptations of Omicron and sub-variants to spike-based vaccines and simultaneous transmissibility underline the urgency for new vaccines in the continuous battle against SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, we have added three persistent T-cell-stimulating nucleocapsid peptides similar to homologous sequences from seasonal Human Coronaviruses (HuCoV) and an envelope peptide that elicits a strong T-cell immune response. These peptides are clustered in the hybrid spike‚Äôs cytoplasmic region with non-immunogenic linkers, enabling systematic arrangement. AlphaFold (Artificial intelligence-based model building) analysis suggests omitting the transmembrane domain enhances these cytoplasmic epitopes‚Äô folding efficiency which can ensure persistent immunity for CD4+ structural epitopes. Further molecular dynamics simulations validate the compact conformation of the modeled structures and a flexible C-terminus region. Overall, the structures show stability and less conformational fluctuation throughout the simulation. Also, the AlphaFold predicted structural epitopes maintained their folds during simulation to ensure the specificity of CD4+ T-cell response after vaccination. Our proposed approach may provide options for incorporating diverse anti-viral T-cell peptides, similar to HuCoV, into linker regions. This versatility can be promising to address outbreaks and challenges posed by various viruses for effective management in this era of innovative vaccines.."
