<p><strong>Transcript</strong>:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Hello everyone, my name is Gang He, and I’m an assistant professor in the Department of Technology and Society at Stony Brook University. I’m grateful for the Integrated Assessment Modeling Consortium 2022 Best Poster Award for online poster presentation.</p>
<p>I’d like to take the opportunity to share the main messages of the paper. To achieve carbon neutrality, the world must embark on a rapid and massive deployment of renewable energy. However, certain decoupling policies that restrict the free flow of capital, talent, and innovation may delay the continuous reduction in costs of renewable energy. The international climate policy now faces a crossroads - to continue relying on global supply chains or to shift towards domestic technology development and production.</p>
<p>Our research captures this policy dilemma and assesses the cost savings associated with a globalized solar PV module supply chain. We created a two-factor hybrid learning model that considers historical capacity, component, and input material prices of solar PV deployment from the United States, Germany, and China. The results show that the globalized PV module market has saved PV installers $24 billion in the US, $7 billion in Germany and $36 billion in China from 2008 to 2020, compared to a scenario where domestic manufacturers increasingly supplied installed capacities over a ten-year period. Projecting the same scenario forward to 2030, we estimate that solar module prices will be about 20-30% higher than with a globalized supply chain. Our findings emphasize the importance of international cooperation in the pursuit of a low-carbon future.</p>

<section id="summary" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>In a new <a href="../../posts/2022-10-nature-cost-savings-of-global-solar-pv-value-chains/index.html">study</a> <span class="citation" data-cites="helveston_he_davidson_2022">Helveston, He, and Davidson (2022)</span> published in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05316-6"><em>Nature</em></a>, we quantify the cost savings from globalized solar module supply chains. We found globalized supply chain has saved installers in the U.S., Germany, and China 67 billion USD from 2008 to 2020. Unit solar module prices would be approximately 20-30% higher in 2030 if countries move to manufacture domestically compared with a future with globalized supply chains.</p>
</section>
<section id="background" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="background">Background</h2>
<p>Three decades. That is how much time is left to decarbonize the world’s energy systems to limit global warming to 1.5°C, according to the latest <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM_final.pdf#page=33">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report</a>. Achieving this feat requires renewable energy systems be deployed at an unprecedented speed and scale. While daunting, the good news is that this transformation may not cost as much as many expected just a decade ago, thanks to rapid cost declines in renewable energy technologies. Solar photovoltaics (PV) is a prime example. In the last decade, the price of solar modules has <a href="https://www.irena.org/publications/2022/Jul/Renewable-Power-Generation-Costs-in-2021">dropped 88 percent</a>, making solar cost-competitive with fossil fuels in many parts of the world.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://www.howsolargotcheap.com/">remarkable success story</a> was made possible by the decades-long free flow of goods, talent and capital across multiple countries involved in the solar industry. But the learning processes that have led to these rapid declines are increasingly at risk from policies aimed at localizing production to within national borders and moving away from global supply chains. Such policies have become increasingly popular, in part due to supply chain disruptions experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic and, perhaps more notably, in response to the concentration of the solar PV supply chain in China, which now comprises <a href="https://doi.org/10.1051/epjpv/2022010">78% of global PV module production</a> (see Figure&nbsp;1).</p>

<p>We have been studying this phenomenon for years, trying to understand the cost of erecting barriers to international cooperation when it comes to the development and deployment of low carbon energy technologies (LCETs) like solar PV. In our recent paper published in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05316-6"><em>Nature</em></a>, we model the cost of moving away from global supply chains for solar PV modules, concluding that tens of billions of dollars have been saved in solar deployment over the past decade thanks to global supply chains.</p>
</section>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="learning-in-global-versus-national-markets">Learning in Global Versus National Markets</h2>
<p>In our paper, we use historical deployment and price data in the U.S., Germany, and China—the three largest solar-deploying countries—to model the cost savings from historical global cooperation in the solar PV industry. Using the classic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_curve">learning curve</a> model, we model historical learning rates in each country from 2006 to 2020, which we call a period of learning in “global market” conditions. We then simulate a counterfactual “national markets” scenario, in which these countries adopt nationalistic trade policies that limit cross-border learning over the same period.</p>
<p>Our results show a total of $67 billion was saved in solar deployment from 2008 to 2020 thanks to global supply chains ($24 billion, $36 billion, and $7 billion in the U.S., China, and Germany, respectively). We also estimate that under the “national markets” scenario, solar panel prices in 2020 would have been significantly higher—107% higher in the U.S., 83% higher in Germany, and 54% higher in China (see Figure&nbsp;2).</p>

<figcaption class="figure-caption">Figure&nbsp;2: Comparison of estimated solar PV module prices under global versus national market scenarios in China (2007–2020), and Germany and the United States (2006–2020).</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>We also compare how these two scenarios might play out going forward. Assuming that capacity grows at a constant annual growth rate (CAGR), we estimate that solar module prices could be 20%-30% higher in 2030 than they otherwise would be if countries move to complete domestic manufacturing over a ten-year time frame.</p>
</section>
<section id="what-about-jobs" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-about-jobs">What About Jobs?</h2>
<p>While we focus on cost in our paper, we offer a discussion of other important issues in the solar PV industry. Jobs is a politically salient issue that is often used to motivate moving solar manufacturing to the U.S. (or another country). But this motivation is inconsistent with industry realities.</p>
<p>The National Renewable Energy Laboratory estimates that there are <a href="https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy21osti/79758.pdf">ten times</a> more annual jobs in system installation compared with those in the entire manufacturing supply chain. As a result, higher module prices associated with nationalistic policies could lead to lower total deployment, costing potentially thousands more jobs than those gained in manufacturing, which is highly automated in most modern module manufacturing plants.</p>
<p>This reality has already played out under the tariffs on imported solar PV modules from China, which have been in place over the past three U.S. administrations. The Solar Energy Industries Association estimated that Section 201 tariffs implemented under the Trump administration has cost the industry <a href="https://www.seia.org/research-resources/high-cost-tariffs">60,000 jobs</a>, and if new tariffs are added that number could <a href="https://www.seia.org/news/tariff-case-cuts-solar-deployment-forecasts-nearly-half-100000-jobs-risk">rise to 100,000</a>. Lowering or completely removing these tariffs would almost certainly accelerate solar deployment (and job growth) in the U.S., especially with the tax credit incentives put in place under the Inflation Reduction Act.</p>
</section>
<section id="what-about-diversification" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-about-diversification">What About Diversification?</h2>
<p>Reliance on a single set of countries in critical supply chains introduces risks to global disruptions, and a diversified solar PV manufacturing base can provide a layer of resilience. A related article in <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/epdf/10.1126/science.abq5446"><em>Science</em></a>, <span class="citation" data-cites="davidson2022risks">Davidson et al. (2022)</span> provides a framework for balancing the economic and national security risks from decoupling from China in mature and emerging low-carbon technologies. Nonetheless, it is also important to consider the risks associated with continued dependence on fossil fuels for energy. While fossil energy prices are highly susceptible to global disruptions, renewable energy systems have no fuel cost. Furthermore, a dependency now on a country like China for solar panels may not exist forever as manufacturing can shift over time; in contrast, fossil energy sources are geographically fixed, limiting potential future trade partners.</p>
<p>Of course, countries may choose to diversify for ethical reasons too. The Xinjiang region of China has been come under increased scrutiny from allegations of forced labor. Most of the world’s solar-grade polysilicon is produced in Xinjiang, and policies such as the Biden Administration’s <a href="https://www.cbp.gov/trade/forced-labor/UFLPA">Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act</a> are aimed at limiting trade with products made in this region. The solar industry has responded with proposed protocols for tracing upstream material supplies, which is an initial step in addressing the issue, but more needs to be done.</p>
</section>
<section id="policy-implications" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="policy-implications">Policy Implications</h2>
<p>In a related <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aaz1014">article in <em>Science</em></a>, <span class="citation" data-cites="helveston2019china">Helveston and Nahm (2019)</span> highlighted China’s critical role in scaling up manufacturing in LCET sectors, including solar, wind, electric vehicles and batteries. Global trade will be critical for scaling up the deployment of these technologies all over the world. While efforts to boost domestic manufacturing of and demand for renewable energy technologies are steps in the right direction, we must not lose site of the timeline left to decarbonize. Erecting barriers to the free flow of goods, talent, and capital in LCET sectors will limit the ability to address the looming climate crisis.</p>
<p>This does not mean the U.S. should abandon solar manufacturing. The world will need more supply to meet the scale of deployment necessary for climate goals, and more solar manufacturers adds resiliency to disruptive events such as pandemics and conflicts. As an R&amp;D leader, the U.S. could very likely lead in developing (and potentially manufacturing) the next-generation of solar PV technology. But the U.S. should not penalize firms for buying low-cost, high-quality panels from abroad, not when cost is still a barrier to greater solar adoption.</p>
<p>There is a Chinese idiom that has a close corollary in the English-speaking world: 同舟共济(tóng zhōu gòng jì), which roughly translates to “same boat, work together.” Time is not on our side. Countries like the U.S. and China must find a way to address their geopolitical differences while simultaneously working together to lower the cost of LCETs, close <a href="https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022?gclid=Cj0KCQiA37KbBhDgARIsAIzce16RWcYDSbNbHM1nHzd4z6GMPt6Xexx1bMzhVGGbV46LPAxH74NqJw8aAmwVEALw_wcB">the emissions gap</a> and combat climate change.</p>

<p>Achieving carbon neutrality requires deploying renewable energy at unprecedented speed and scale, yet countries sometimes implement policies that increase costs by restricting the free flow of capital, talent and innovation in favour of localizing benefits such as economic growth, employment and trade surpluses. Here we assess the cost savings from a globalized solar photovoltaic (PV) module supply chain. We develop a two-factor learning model using historical capacity, component and input material price data of solar PV deployment in the United States, Germany and China. We estimate that the globalized PV module market has saved PV installers US$24 (19–31) billion in the United States, US$7 (5–9) billion in Germany and US$36 (26–45) billion in China from 2008 to 2020 compared with a counterfactual scenario where domestic manufacturers supply an increasing proportion of installed capacities over a ten-year period. Projecting the same scenario forwards from 2020 results in estimated solar module prices that are approximately 20–30 per cent higher in 2030 compared with a future with globalized supply chains. International climate policy benefits from a globalized low-carbon value chain, and these results point to the need for complementary policies to mitigate welfare distribution effects and potential impacts on technological crowding out.</p>

<p>The only question is, how much nuclear power will be needed in the mix?</p>
<p>“From my research, China’s future power system will be quite sensitive to how much nuclear [power] China can put online,” Gang He, assistant professor at Stony Brook University in the U.S., told Nikkei Asia. “I have seen the nuclear power projections by 2050 outlining an increase from 300 GW to 500 GW.”</p>
<p>Gang added that China’s need for nuclear power could be kept down at around 300 GW, “if China manages to accelerate the expansion and integration of solar, wind and other renewables,” but that would require an installed capacity of 800-1,000 GW in renewables to cope with generating fluctuations.</p>

<p>Q: China, as we know has a long-term plan to increase the proportion of nuclear energy into its energy mix. What are the advantages and risks of such ambition?</p>
<p>A: Energy strategy and policy are about trade-offs and fit in specific conditions and constraints. The political economy dynamics of different energy technologies will have a large impact on the outcomes.</p>
<p>From my research, China’s future power system will be quite sensitive to how much nuclear can China put online. I have seen 2050 nuclear projections and plans range from about 300GW to 500GW, this 200GW differences will need about 800-1000GW more wind and solar capacity to fill the gap, as nuclear plants can run at 90% capacity factor with little or no impact from weather. However, if China manages to accelerate the expansion and integration of solar, wind, and other renewables, then the need for nuclear will be reduced to its lower end, with less pressure on nuclear risks and nuclear waste management.</p>
<p>We will see renewables and nuclear expand hand in hand in the short term to achieve carbon peak and carbon neutrality in the medium and long-term, but the comparative scale will be shaped by the changing political economy of those technologies.</p>

<p>The deployment of renewable energy sources, power-to-gas (P2G) systems, and zero-emission vehicles provide a synergistic opportunity to accelerate the decarbonization of both power and transportation system. This article investigates the prospects of implementing hydrogen P2G technology in coupling the power system and the transportation system. A novel coordinated long-term planning model of integrated power and transportation system (IPTS) at the regional scale is proposed to simulate the power system balance and travel demand balance simultaneously, while subject to a series of constraints, such as CO2 emission constraints. IPTS of Texas was investigated considering various CO2 emission cap scenarios. Results show unique decarbonization trajectories of the proposed coordinated planning model, in which IPTS prefers to decarbonizing the power sector firstly. When the power system reaches ultralow carbon intensity, the IPTS then focuses on the road transportation system decarbonization. The results show that with the P2G system, IPTS of Texas could achieve 100% CO2 emission reductions (relative 2018 emissions level) by adding a combination of approximately 143.5 GW of wind, 50 GW of solar PV, and 40 GW of P2G systems with 2.5% renewables curtailment. The integration of the P2G system can produce hydrogen by use of surplus RES generation to meet hydrogen demand of Fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) and to meet multiday electricity supply imbalances.</p>

<p>Clean power transition is at the center to achieve mid-century carbon neutrality goals. The cost of solar and wind has plummeted in the past decade, and solar and wind electricity has been achieving grid parity. Low-cost renewables offer new perspectives for energy system decarbonization that was less visioned before. In this talk, Dr.&nbsp;He will discuss the pathways of clean power transition and their system impacts using high-resolution models, to reflect the need for integrating variable renewable energy and phasing out coal to achieve carbon neutrality in the power sector at a low-cost renewables era.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>Thank you, Jessica, for the nice introduction.</p>
<p>Let me start by congratulating Dr.&nbsp;Cui and the team for the release of such an important and timely report. I want to echo what Prof.&nbsp;Yuan have just shown the implications of China’s coal transition. The report lays down a ground break work to identify low hanging fruits of coal plants retirement and shows a feasible strategy to phase down coal power in China.</p>
<p>I hope to add a few comments focusing on renewables. You may curious this is coal phase down event, why am I talking about renewables. Here is the thing, it’s good to phase down coal, then where will our electricity come from? The answer is: non-fossil sources, especially renewables! My rationale is that the more we can provide stable and secure renewables supply, the less we will rely on coal, and the better chance we can successfully phase down coal.</p>
<p>First, China’s clean power transition needs two accelerations at the same time. While accelerating phase down of coal, we will need to accelerate renewable development and integration. Renewables will need to first feed all the new demand and then to replace coal. Let’s be real, coal generation is still growing, good news is the share of renewables grows too. In <a href="https://www.cec.org.cn/upload/1/editor/1642758964482.pdf">2021</a>, coal accounts about 62% of total generation, hydro about 16%, nuclear 5%, wind 8%, and solar 4%. Renewables (hydro, wind, and solar) overtook coal in new capacity in <a href="https://github.com/drganghe/Rapid-and-Just-Coal-Transition-in-China">2013</a>, and renewable combined exceeded 50% of the new capacity in 2016, and in 2021, 78% of the new capacity are renewables. According to the latest data from the National Energy Administration, by the end of 2021, the country’s installed wind and solar capacity both exceeded 300 GW, wind 328GW and solar 306GW. To achieve carbon neutrality goal, we need 10x today’s solar and wind capacity by mid-century, that’s the scale of acceleration we are talking here.</p>
<p>Second, cheap renewables are a game changer, a renewable dominant path is not just technical feasible, but also cost effective, and with water saving and other co-benefits. This chart from <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/cheap-renewables-growth">Our World in Data</a> shows that from 2009 to 2019 the cost of PV fell by 90 percent, onshore wind by 70%, and concentrated solar by 16%. The learning rate reaches 36% for PV and 23% for onshore wind, meaning that for every doubling of cumulative installed capacity, the cost of PV fell 36% and onshore wind 23%. 2021 can be described as the tipping point of grid parity or we say, “low-cost renewable era”. In China, the <a href="https://www.ndrc.gov.cn/xwdt/tzgg/202106/t20210611_1283089.html">National Development and Reform Commission</a>, canceled the subsidized tariff for new central PV and onshore wind projects, a milestone for renewables. The arrival of grid parity, relative to the 2000 forecast, about 50 years ahead of time; relative to the 2010 forecast, about 30 years ahead of time; relative to the 2015 forecast, about 10 years ahead of time. The early arrival of grid parity accelerates the development of renewable energy and opens new possibilities for achieving carbon neutrality to confront climate change.</p>
<p>In a collaborative <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-16184-x"><em>Nature Communications</em></a> paper with Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, we found that if the current trend of declining renewables costs continues, by 2030, wind and solar could provide 39% of electricity generation, together with hydro (14%) and nuclear (10%), the share of non-fossil electricity could be 62%, compared to 50% commonly discussed. What’s more, it will be 11% cheaper than in the reference scenario. Wind and solar together could exceed 1800GW of capacity, compared to the 1200GW national goal. In another collaborative <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095965262103941X">paper</a> with Tongji University, we find cheap renewables reduces the need for carbon capture and storage by 80% in 2050 and saves water consumption for cooling by 10 billion cubic meters annually compared with the reference scenario.</p>
<p>Third, coal could play a facilitator’s role in integrating renewables, coal needs to reposition or repurpose itself from cornerstone to stepstone in clean power transition. Flexibility retrofitting and converting coal plants to reserved capacity could help to address the flexibility challenges in a renewable dominant grid, even though coal flexibility’s contribution to renewable integration is marginal comparing to building national electricity market and dispersed renewable investments, accordingly to a collaborative paper with LBL published in <a href="https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(22)00019-0"><em>iScience</em></a>.</p>
<p>In summary, accelerating coal transition and renewable development needs to go hand in hand, and renewable achieving grid parity not just make this technical feasible, but also economic effective, and coal could reposition and repurpose itself from footstone to stepstone in clean power transition.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>China is currently the world’s largest emitter of carbon dioxide (CO2). China therefore has a key role in global climate change mitigation. Policies and commitments are required to enable decarbonization. In this Perspective, we summarize the key features of China’s CO2 emissions, its reduction processes and successes in meeting climate targets. China’s CO2 emissions reductions have been substantial by 2020, carbon intensity decreased by 48.4 percent compared to 2005 levels, achieving objectives outlined in the Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions and Nationally Determined Contributions. These reductions rely on the achievements of sectoral and sub-national targets outlined by China’s Five-Year Plans. However, China still faces the challenges of reaching its peak total CO2 emissions before 2030 and achieving carbon neutrality before 2060. Key steps towards China’s carbon neutrality include increasing its non-fossil energy share, deploying negative-emission technologies at large scale, promoting regional low-carbon development and establishing a nationwide ‘green market’. To achieve these steps, top-down socio-economic development plans must coincide with bottom-up economic incentives and technology development.</p>

<p>Renewable energy is poised to play a major role in achieving China’s carbon neutrality goal by 2060; however, reliability and flexibility is a big concern of a renewable-dominant power system. Various strategies of enhancing flexibility are under discussion to ensure the reliability of such a system, but no detailed quantitative analysis has been reported yet in China. We combine the advantages of a capacity expansion model, SWITCH-China, with a production simulation model, PLEXOS, and analyze flexibility options under different scenarios of a renewable-dominant power system in China. We find that a larger balancing area offers direct flexibility benefits. Regional balancing could reduce the renewable curtailment rate by 5–7%, compared with a provincial balancing strategy. National balancing could further reduce the power cost by about 16%. However, retrofitting coal power plants for flexible operation would only improve the system flexibility marginally.</p>

<p>Deep carbon mitigation and water resources conservation are two interacted environmental challenges that China’s power sector is facing. We investigate long-term transition pathways (2020–2050) of China’s power sector under carbon neutrality target and water withdrawal constraint using an integrated capacity expansion and dispatch model: SWITCH-China. We find that achieving carbon neutrality before 2060 under moderate cost decline of renewables by 10–20% depends heavily on large scale deployment of coal-fired power generation with carbon capture and storage (CCS) since 2035 in China’s water-deficient northwestern regions, which may incur significant water penalties in arid catchments. Introducing water withdrawal constraints at the secondary river basin level can reduce the reliance on coal-CCS power generation to achieve carbon neutrality, promote the application of air-cooling technology, and reallocate newly built coal power capacities from northwestern regions to northeastern and southern regions. If levelized cost of renewables can decline rapidly by about 70%, demand for coal power generation with CCS will be significantly reduced by more than 80% and solar photovoltaic (PV) and wind could account for about 70% of the national total power generation by 2050. The transition pathway under low-cost renewables also creates water conservation co-benefits of around 10 billion m3 annually compared to the reference scenario.</p>

<p>We investigated the applications of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms in wind power technology changes over time and found that AI accelerates the automation of wind power systems. This study shows evidence of the evolution of wind technology innovation following the advancement in AI algorithms using the patents data issued in four intellectual property (IP) offices from 1980 through 2017. Artificial intelligence and more advanced data analytics can be effectively applied to increase the efficiency of wind power systems and to optimize wind farm operations. This study empirically analyzes the evolution of applications of AI algorithms in wind power technology by employing machine learning-based text mining and network analysis, demonstrating the dynamic changing pattern of applications of AI algorithms in wind power technology innovation.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Sorting garbage is messy, but important. Finding means to recover recyclable material from waste and putting it back into the product stream is critical to our sustainable future. That is why the Department of Technology and Society has been awarded $4.25 million by New York State to “characterize” its solid waste and improve its recycling.</p>
</section>
<section id="sbu-news" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sbu-news">SBU News</h2>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The five-year contract is with the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC), Division of Materials Management. The project is led by Principal Investigators (PI) Professors David Tonjes and Elizabeth Hewitt, Co-PI Professor Gang He, and Research Professor Krista Thyberg. The primary task is to sample a set of municipal waste systems statewide to determine the composition of managed wastes and recyclables.</p>
<p>Professor Tonjes has worked on New York solid waste issues for 30 years, in both technical and policy applications. Professor Hewitt is a planner with a strong background in researching human behavior and motivations in environmental settings. Professor He has conducted extensive research on recent energy and environmental management in China in terms of both infrastructure and policy changes. Professor Thyberg has been working on solid waste issues for about 10 years, including iconic work on managing food waste. They will be supported by teams of graduate students enrolled in doctoral and masters programs in the Department, and undergraduate students drawn mostly from the Technological Systems Management major.</p>
<p>Student teams get the job of sorting garbage into more than 20 categories to determine variations across the State and within different kinds of management programs. Data will provide characterizations at a variety of scales, from individual truck routes to the State as a whole. The first year’s work, which was impacted by the pandemic, was restricted to sorting wastes at a number of recycling facilities and at two Long Island locations. The students found time during lock down to assemble data from nearly 200 waste sorts done by others across the country over the past several decades to put the New York work into context.</p>
<p>“Similarities and differences across data sets will help refine State policies and regulations regarding solid waste management,” said Tonjes, associate research professor in the Department of Technology &amp; Society in Stony Brook’s College of Engineering and Applied Sciences (CEAS). “Our ultimate goal is to enable municipal waste managers to better target recovery and other management efforts while leading to refined or new means to promote more environmentally favorable behaviors.”</p>
<p>This summer the sampling teams will fan out across the State and analyze samples at a number of disposal and recycling facilities. The data will not only be used to measure the effectiveness and efficiency of current programs but also to support other NYSDEC-funded recycling research programs, including work at the New York State Pollution Prevention Institute in Rochester, the University at Buffalo, SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry, and Alfred University.</p>
<p>Year one also saw the completion of other related research projects supported by the NYSDEC grant by two smaller teams of student researchers:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first created an interactive web-based model to allow local planners to determine which materials are economically favored for recycling. This will allow for potential expansion of municipal recycling menus in sustainable directions. The model has been created and tested, and now the project report is being finalized for release later this spring.</li>
<li>The second project investigated the interplay between market specifications and economics, recycling facility engineering choices, and policies adopted in China and by other jurisdictions that affect recycling. In 2017-2018, these factors merged to catastrophically collapse global recyclables markets. This research has explored the drivers for these intertwined forces and will help those proposing recycling regulations and planning technology implementations to mitigate the potential for similar events, and potentially to provide direction for recyclables processing for more long-term market sustainability. The reports detailing the findings are being prepared and will also be available in Spring 2021.</li>
<li>A third related recycling research project will analyze the principles of the “circular economy” and determine the potential for recycling (especially “first order” recycling, which is when old newspaper is turned into new newspaper, not toilet paper, for instance) to play an important role in creating sustainable materials management. The project will focus on the classic set of recyclable materials (newspaper, cardboard, glass, metals, plastics) to determine what kinds of factors may limit first order recycling, which can lead to better expectations for market development and pursuit of innovative uses of collected materials destined for reuse. This project has just started and is expected to take two years to complete.</li>
</ul>
<p>“The Department of Technology &amp; Society blends engineering principles with social responsibility to help ensure that advances in technology truly benefit the community,” said Robert Kukta, acting dean, CEAS. “With population growth and increasing waste production, effective recycling is a critical issue for global sustainability. This project is a large step in the right direction not only for New York, but as a model for other locales.”</p>

<p>As the world’s largest coal producer and consumer, China’s transition from coal to cleaner energy sources is critical for achieving global decarbonization. Increasing regulations on air pollution and carbon emissions and decreasing costs of renewables drive China’s transition away from coal; however, this transition also has implications for employment and social justice. Here, we assess China’s current coal-transition policies, their barriers, and the potential for an accelerated transition, as well as the associated environmental, human health, and employment and social justice issues that may arise from the transition. We estimate that the most aggressive coal-transition pathway could reduce annual premature death related to coal combustion by 224,000 and reduce annual water consumption by 4.3 billion m3 in 2050 compared with business-as-usual. We highlight knowledge gaps and conclude with policy recommendations for an integrated approach to facilitate a rapid and just transition away from coal in China.</p>

<p>August 21, 2020</p>
<p>China is the world’s largest producer and consumer of coal. A team of international scientists led by Stony Brook University’s Gang He, contend that China needs to transition away from coal to help the world achieve global decarbonization and improve the nation’s environmental and human health. In a perspective paper published in One Earth, the team outlines steps that can be taken for an albeit difficult, yet just and quicker transition away from coal.</p>
<p>The study proposes a political-socio-economic perspective targeting an integrated value chain to highlight a few overarching strategies and implementing policies accelerating China’s transition away from coal. This is different from the conventional discussion on coal transition, which usually centers on air pollution, carbon emission and competition from renewables.</p>
<p>“Our paper is an effort to include in the overall discussion the employment and social justice impacts, including environmental justice, of such a transition,” said Dr.&nbsp;He, assistant professor in the Department of Technology and Society in the College of Engineering and Applied Sciences at Stony Brook University.</p>
<p>“The benefits of China’s transition away from coal is huge. We estimate that the most aggressive coal-transition pathway could reduce premature death related to coal combustion by 224,000 in 2050, compared to the business-as-usual scenario,” said Dr.&nbsp;He. “Similarly, our maximum estimated reduction in water consumption, arguably the most vital of all resources, is about 4.3 billion m3 in 2050.”</p>
<p>The researchers argue that for a rapid transition away from coal, China needs to take these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Retire coal generating plants earlier and cancel newly planned coal projects.</li>
<li>Reduce the nation’s coal consumption beyond the massive power sector.</li>
<li>A rapid transition presents economic and social challenges that should be met with new economic opportunities.</li>
<li>Attempt to align the motivations and incentives of key business and government stakeholders, which are often not coordinated.</li>
</ul>
<p>Dr.&nbsp;He emphasizes that a successful coal transition would involve changes that must take into account the well-being and economic security of some three million people who work in coal mining-related jobs in China, as well as another 500,000 who work within the coal power industry. A just transition away from coal, the authors write, also needs to accommodate low-income groups that rely on abundant, cheap and readily available coal for basic electricity and heating service.</p>
<p>To start the transition, the authors propose the creation of a dedicated task force charged with facilitating action plans to be carried out and a process that serves the best interests of affected stakeholders and China’s diverse population.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>In a new <a href="../../posts/2020-05-ncomms-rapid-re-cost/index.html">study</a> <span class="citation" data-cites="he_rapid_2020">He et al. (2020)</span> published in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-16184-x"><em>Nature Communications</em></a>, we explore the implications of clean-energy cost trends for the electricity system in China over the next decade. We found that if China uses the most cost-effective renewable energy resources, it could generate more than 60% of its electricity from “non-fossil” sources by 2030 – including wind, solar, hydro and nuclear – at a cost that is around 10% lower than under business-as-usual.</p>
</section>
<section id="background" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="background">Background</h2>
<p>The costs for solar, wind and battery storage have dropped markedly since 2010 and are expected to decline further in the near future. This rapid fall in costs could have a large effect on energy system investment and policies, but has not been fully captured in energy modelling.</p>
<p>This is particularly relevant for China, which is now debating whether to build hundreds of new coal-fired power plants in the 2020s, despite overcapacity and financial distress in the sector.</p>
<p>In a new study, published in Nature Communications, we worked with my colleagues to explore the implications of clean-energy cost trends for the electricity system in China over the next decade.</p>
<p>We found that if China uses the most cost-effective renewable energy resources, it could generate more than 60% of its electricity from “non-fossil” sources by 2030 – including wind, solar, hydro and nuclear – at a cost that is around 10% lower than under business-as-usual.</p>
<p>This cleaner electricity mix would still reliably meet rising demand. This suggests China could raise its target to get 50% of its electricity from non-fossil sources by 2030, while saving money.</p>
</section>
<section id="balancing-priorities" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="balancing-priorities">Balancing priorities</h2>
<p>It is often said that renewable sources of electricity, such as wind and solar, are variable and expensive. However, the recent innovation in technology and operation of electricity grids – and, in particular, the availability of cheaper storage – have changed the industry outlook.</p>
<p>In this study, we used an electricity system capacity expansion model (SWITCH-China) to explore how the Chinese power system could be expanded to meet rising electricity demand. We developed four scenarios for 2030 to explore the implications of a continued, rapid decrease in renewable energy costs.</p>
<p>The scenarios are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Business-as-usual scenario (BAU), which assumes the continuation of current policies and moderate cost decreases in future renewable costs;</p></li>
<li><p>Low-cost renewables scenario (R), which assumes the rapid recent decrease in costs for renewables and storage will continue;</p></li>
<li><p>Carbon constraints scenario (C50), which has a power-sector carbon cap of 50% below 2015 levels in 2030, on top of the R scenario;</p></li>
<li><p>Deep carbon constraints scenario (C80), which further constrain the carbon emissions from the power sector to be 80% lower than the 2015 level by 2030.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>All scenarios assume the same electricity demand projection, which reaches 8,757 terawatt hours (TWh) in 2030, up from 7,225TWh today.</p>
<p>Our modeling results show that, as expected, rapid decreases in the costs of renewable energy sources lead to more wind and solar capacity being installed. If the levelised cost of energy (LCOE) for solar, wind and storage follows recent global trends then, by 2030, China could meet expected demand with 62% of its electricity from non-fossil sources under the R scenario with the lowest overall cost.</p>
<p>This “R” scenario is shown in Figure&nbsp;1, in the second column on the right-hand side, with wind (green) and solar (yellow) providing 39% of the total. As a result of higher non-fossil output, coal-based generation (black) could be just 3,700TWh in 2030 under the R scenario, some 30% lower than under BAU (4,900TWh). Battery storage (orange) and small amounts of gas (purple) generation would supplement the increasing wind and solar supplies.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="wind-solar-and-storage-growth">Wind, solar and storage growth</h2>
<p>Non-fossil sources of electricity would need to grow their capacity dramatically over the next decade if they are to meet such significant shares of electricity demand in China. Figure&nbsp;2 shows the capacity of each source, in gigawatts (GW), under the four scenarios.</p>
<p>By 2030, wind and solar capacity would reach 660GW and 1,260GW under the “R” scenario, respectively. These figures can be compared with current wind and solar capacity of 210GW and 204GW, respectively.</p>

-->
<p>With wind and solar generating increasing shares of China’s electricity, there would be a growing need for system flexibility and storage capacity to help integrate their variable output, while reliably meeting demand at all times.</p>
<p>By 2030, storage capacity – including from batteries – is just 34GW under BAU, but needs to grow to as much as 307GW in the R scenario, as shown in orange in Figure&nbsp;2 above.</p>
<p>To put this in context, pumped hydro capacity in China in 2015 was about 25GW and has been expanding very quickly. In our scenarios, it is estimated to reach up to 130GW by 2030, with the remaining 177GW coming from battery storage or other storage technology.</p>
<p>This large capacity would be very ambitious to deploy in a comparatively short time, requiring about 11.8GW annually during the period we modelled. If battery efficiency and performance were to improve more quickly than we assumed, the needed storage capacity would be smaller.</p>

<section id="cost-of-carbon-mitigation" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="cost-of-carbon-mitigation">Cost of carbon mitigation</h2>
<p>In the next part of our research, we evaluate the CO2 emissions impact due to increasing generation from renewable energy and decreasing generation from fossil fuels. Our results show that a low-cost renewables (R) scenario would result in 25% lower emissions, at 2,970 million metric tonnes of CO2 (MtCO2) in 2030 versus 3,980MtCO2 under the BAU scenario.</p>
<p>This is shown in the left-hand chart in Figure&nbsp;3, where power-sector CO2 emissions would be expected to remain relatively constant under BAU (blue line), but would fall rapidly over the next decade under the “R” low-cost renewables pathway (orange).</p>

-->
<p>Given the remarkable and ongoing reductions in the cost of renewable power, the 25% reduction in carbon emissions could be achieved for a lower cost of power under the R scenario than under the BAU scenario, as shown in Figure&nbsp;3 right.</p>
<p>In 2030, total costs under the R scenario are 11% lower than those under the BAU scenario. As a result, the implied cost of carbon reduction would be -$36 per tonne of CO2. Even under the carbon cap (C50) scenario, China could eliminate half of its 2015 emissions from the power sector by 2030 at 6% lower cost, while delivering 77% of electricity from non-fossil sources.</p>

<section id="regional-power-trade" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="regional-power-trade">Regional power trade</h2>
<p>In the final part of our work, we examined the regional implications of rising renewable output for the power system in 2030. In particular, we found regional disparities in the location of the most cost-effective renewable energy resources in China.</p>
<p>With the assumed decrease in costs for solar, wind and storage technologies, the northwest region could emerge as a national supplier of carbon-neutral electricity, while the eastern grid could become increasingly import-dependent to meet its demand.</p>
<p>Such a regional imbalance would become larger with greater penetration of renewables, as would the need for inter-provincial transmission lines. For each region on the map, Figure&nbsp;4 shows electricity generation from each fuel in 2030, under the four different scenarios that we studied. The dotted lines show that region’s electricity demand and the magenta arrows represent electricity flows from one region to another in the R scenario.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="clean-energy-transition-and-post-covid-recovery">Clean energy transition and post-Covid recovery</h2>
<p>As China drafts its 14th five-year plan (due next year) and deliberates its own post-Covid economic recovery measures, our research offers valuable insights into the cheapest ways to meet the country’s rising electricity demand.</p>
<p>Most notably, we found that China could cut emissions from its power sector at lower overall cost than a business-as-usual approach, by relying more heavily on renewables and storage. This would have co-benefits including reducing harmful air pollution, cutting water use and creating green jobs.</p>
<p>In contrast, there are signs that some local governments are fast-tracking more new coal power plants this year, despite the fact that half of China’s existing capacity is already losing money and the entire fleet only operates half the time, a sign of overcapacity.</p>
<p>While it should save money overall, the scale of the transformation implied by our work is significant and would require a very rapid acceleration of current progress. The capacity of renewables and storages, as well as transmission infrastructure, would need to be scaled up very quickly.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, our analysis shows that such a fast decarbonisation and clean power transition is both technically feasible and economically beneficial.</p>
<p>Options to bring such a transition about could include long-term targets for clean energy, such as a zero-emission power target, as well as electricity market reforms. This could create incentives to reduce institutional barriers to trading power across regions and to better integrate renewable energy.</p>

<p>The costs for solar photovoltaics, wind, and battery storage have dropped markedly since 2010, however, many recent studies and reports around the world have not adequately captured such dramatic decrease. Those costs are projected to decline further in the near future, bringing new prospects for the widespread penetration of renewables and extensive power-sector decarbonization that previous policy discussions did not fully consider. Here we show if cost trends for renewables continue, 62% of China’s electricity could come from non-fossil sources by 2030 at a cost that is 11% lower than achieved through a business-as-usual approach. Further, China’s power sector could cut half of its 2015 carbon emissions at a cost about 6% lower compared to business-as-usual conditions.</p>

<p>June 1, 2020</p>
<p>The News in Brief:</p>
<ul>
<li>This study is the first to reveal the implications of cost decrease on power systems and new perspectives on clean power transition.</li>
<li>The analysis uses China’s power system as a case study to demonstrate the impact of a fast cost decrease of renewable and storage source, a scenario that could apply to the United States.</li>
<li>The study reveals fast decarbonization is both technically feasible and economically beneficial, which offers the prospect of large emissions mitigation with a global environmental impact.</li>
</ul>
<p>STONY BROOK, NY, June 1, 2020 – The costs for solar photovoltaics, wind, and battery storage have dropped markedly since 2010. A new study led by Stony Brook University and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory analyses the cost of renewable energy in China and reveals that costs are projected to decline further, thereby bringing new possibilities for the widespread penetration of renewable energy and extensive power-sector decarbonization. The findings, published in Nature Communications, may serve as a model for the United States and worldwide illustrating that decreases in renewable costs may help drive clean energy growth.</p>
<p>Previous studies and reports globally have not adequately captured the dramatic decrease in costs of renewable energy and storage and therefore have underestimated the development of renewables. The authors contend that incorporating the new downward trend in costs of renewable energy into models is invaluable for modeling scenarios that are required for developing appropriate energy policies in countries.</p>
<p>“For too long relying on variable wind and solar resources for electricity generation has been considered a challenge to system operations and as having no economic advantage,” said Gang He, Assistant Professor in the Department of Technology and Society in the College of Engineering and Applied Sciences at Stony Brook University.</p>
<p>“Now rapid technological developments and falling costs in renewable energy and storage are undermining this assumption. Our paper is an effort to reveal the implications of such changes for China’s clean power transition.”</p>
<p>Global weighted-average cost of electricity of utility-scale solar PV, onshore wind, and battery storage in China plummeted by 77, 35, and 85 percent, respectively, between 2010 and 2018. The researchers incorporated these falling costs into models for the development of China’s power sector, a factor often overlooked in power sector modelling.</p>
<p>The modelling showed four scenarios for China’s power sector up to 2030, the business as usual approach, low cost renewable use, carbon constraints, and deep carbon constraints. Their findings with the models revealed that if cost trends continue, 62 percent of China’s electricity would come from non-fossil sources by 2030 at a cost that is 11 percent lower than achieved through a business-as-usual approach.</p>
<p>The authors emphasize that expansion of renewables under the low-cost scenario would require significant infrastructure support in the form of transmission lines and storage capacity to allow grid stability.</p>
<p>“The large-scale decarbonization of the power sector requires that several processes take place simultaneously,” explains Dr.&nbsp;He. “Both the renewable and storage capacity and transmission infrastructure must be scaled up quickly. The investment needed for the infrastructure transformation must be acquired and dedicated. And social and economic equity must be addressed during the transition to lower carbon power systems.”</p>
<p>If such processes can be achieved simultaneously, added Dr.&nbsp;He, China will be able to increase renewables in an increasingly cost-effective manner. Such a model may show that fast decarbonization is both technically feasible and economically beneficial, a scenario that offers the prospect of large emissions mitigation with a global environmental impact.</p>
<p>The research was supported by the Energy Foundation China, and the Hewlett and MJS Foundation through the U.S. Department of Energy under Contract Number No.&nbsp;DE-AC02-05CH11231.</p>

<p>On January 9-10, 2020, the <a href="https://www.stonybrook.edu/est/">Department of Technology and Society</a>, Stony Brook University, hosted an NSF funded workshop entitled “Data Science Across the Undergraduate Curriculum: University-Industry Online Case Studies on Applications of Data Science.” This workshop is supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1912159">1912159</a>.</p>
<p>Three keynote speakers, sixteen panelists addressed participants who included industry representatives, faculty and students discussing how data science undergraduate programs can best meet the nation’s increasing demand for the STEM workforce. With the goal of creating initial plans for curriculum design and assessment frameworks, this workshop illuminated the need to improve undergraduate data science education through university and industry partnerships.</p>
<p>The workshop was kicked off by Fotis Sotiropoulos, Dean of the College of Engineering and Applied Sciences (CEAS), in which he highlighted the exciting STEM science education programs within CEAS and the contribution of the late Dr.&nbsp;David Ferguson, a national leader in STEM education who passed in 2019. Dean Sotiropoulos invited the participants to “envision the future of education and research in the era of intelligent machines.”</p>
<p>Keynote speaker Jay Labov, former Senior Advisor for the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, criticized current education practice in data science. He argued that too many students leave STEM majors because they do not find math formulas taught in class relevant to them. He said, “Most students would say ’I left STEM because it doesn’t speak to me. I thought I was going to be here, trying to help solve the world’s problems. What I find myself was in the classroom with five hundred undergraduates with a talking head in front putting up all kinds of equations that make no sense.”</p>
<p>In response, a panel, including Anand Rao (Data &amp; Analytics PwC), Bonita London (Psychology SBU), Wei Zhu (Applied Math and Statistics SBU), and Nikki Evans (Director of Workforce Partnerships, CUNY), moderated by Marianna Savoca (Career Center SBU), presented their ideas to plug the leaky STEM pipeline through innovations in classroom teaching and industry-university partnerships.</p>
<p>Minghua Zhang, Interim Provost of Stony Brook University, joined the workshop for lunch to welcome all participants and highlighted the challenges and uncertainties both in data collecting and data analyzing.</p>
<p>In the second keynote, Carrie Cullen Hitt, Executive Director of the National Offshore Wind Research and Development Consortium, illustrated how data science can improve efficiency in energy sectors by collecting and monitoring information generated, for instance, by wind turbines. Built on that premise, two panels further reviewed data science applications for clean energy and urban sustainability respectively. Panelists included: Vijay Modi (Columbia University), Vincent Guastamacchia (PSEG Long Island) led by Gang He (Technology and Society SBU), and Mark Rodgers (Rutgers Business School), Jeremy Schneider (The Alliance for Downtown NY), Omkar Aphale (Cascadia), Daniel Cisek (National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency), Katrina Sutton and Vaishnavi Karanam (UC Davis) moderated by Elizabeth Hewitt (Tech and Society SBU).</p>
<p>Addressing data science misuse in the third keynote, Suresh Venkatasubramanian, Professor in the School of Computing at the University of Utah, unearthed hidden decisions involving ethical dilemmas that data scientists must make throughout their work pipeline, from data collection through insights generation. “We do make many implicit choices in every stage of the pipeline when we do the analysis. We don’t often think about whether these have any long-term consequences,” he said.</p>
<p>The final session, moderated by Wolf Schäfer (Technology and Society SBU), highlighted the need for ethics training in data science majors. In the panel, Derek Leben (University of Pittsburgh), Carl Hobert (author and conflict resolution expert), Robert Crease (Philosophy SBU), and Daniene Byrne (Technology and Society SBU) shared their work examining ethical decision process in data science and technology applications.</p>
