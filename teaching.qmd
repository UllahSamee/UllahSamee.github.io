This workshop provided computational trainings and lab-based experience to graduates and undergraduates in the application of structural biology tools and techniques to understand the inner workings of proteins machinery of the cell. Exploiting technological advances to transform our understanding of proteins mechanisms such as protein-protein interactions, protein-ligand interactions will require scientists who have been trained across the distinct disciplines of natural sciences, structural biologists and molecular biologists. The iSM Programme addresses this training need and will help prepare participants to be successful in a variety of biological fields.

**Projects covered topics;** SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics, primers designing, PCR, sequence analysis, Vaccine targets prediction, In-Silico vaccine designing, protein structure and function analysis, structure-based drug designing (SBDD), Virtual screenings, molecular modeling, protein structure quality assessments, Insilico pharmacokinetics, ADMET, lead optimization, drug-likeness, ligand-based structure similarity searching, and chemoinformatics to build virtual drug libraries for therapeutic purpose against infectious diseases.
